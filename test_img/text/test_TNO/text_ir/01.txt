The image, captured in infrared, shows two individuals standing outside a building, possibly in a rural or semi-rural setting. One person appears to be walking towards the left, while the other is facing forward, near what looks like a small structure or shed. The background features bare trees and part of another building, suggesting a cold or leafless season.

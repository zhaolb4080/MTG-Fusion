The image, captured in infrared, shows a fox in a natural setting, likely during nighttime. The fox is highlighted by its heat signature, making it appear bright against the darker, cooler background of dense trees and underbrush. This type of imaging is typically used for wildlife observation and research, especially in low-light conditions.

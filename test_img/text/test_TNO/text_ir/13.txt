The image shows two buildings, possibly residential, captured in infrared photography, which gives them a ghostly, ethereal appearance. The buildings are surrounded by trees and there is a visible expanse in the foreground that looks like a snow-covered ground, reflecting infrared light strongly. Clouds can be seen in the sky, adding to the overall surreal and slightly obscured quality of the scene.

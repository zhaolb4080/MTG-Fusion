This infrared image depicts a residential street scene, featuring two houses on the left with distinct architectural details and a driveway leading up to one of them. The street is lined with trees, and there is a visible contrast in the foliage's texture compared to the buildings and the sky. The overall atmosphere is eerie and ghostly due to the infrared effect, which inverts the usual light and dark areas, making the sky appear dark and the vegetation bright.

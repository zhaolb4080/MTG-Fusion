This infrared image captures a nighttime street scene, showing two cars moving on the road and a pedestrian crossing the street. The thermal signatures indicate that the engines of the cars and the body of the pedestrian are warmer than the surrounding environment. Street lights and traffic signals are also visible, contributing to the urban setting of the image.

This infrared image captures a scene by a body of water, likely a river or lake, surrounded by dense trees. In the foreground, a person is visible in a small boat, possibly engaged in an activity like fishing or rowing. The infrared technology highlights thermal contrasts, making the water appear dark while the trees and the person emit lighter tones, indicating varying temperatures in the scene.

This infrared image depicts a person standing at the end of a narrow, elevated walkway, which is likely a bridge, surrounded by a darker landscape. The person appears brighter in the image, indicating they are emitting more infrared radiation, possibly due to body heat. The structure of the bridge is detailed with railings and rivets, and the environment is less distinct, suggesting a cooler temperature compared to the human figure.

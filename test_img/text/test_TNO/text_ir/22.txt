This infrared image captures a scene with a building that has a triangular roof and a visible entrance where a person is standing. The surrounding area includes leafless trees and a fence, suggesting a colder season or a dormant period for vegetation. A prominent circular object, possibly a street lamp, is seen on the right side of the frame, contributing to the composition of the image.

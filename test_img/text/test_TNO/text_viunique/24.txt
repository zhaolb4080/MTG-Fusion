In the visible light image, the details of the building's structure, such as the texture of the walls and the roof tiles, are more discernible. The surrounding environment, including the trees and the ground cover, appears more defined and varied in texture. Additionally, the contrast between different elements in the scene, like the buildings and the natural landscape, is more pronounced, enhancing depth perception.

The visible light image distinctly shows the natural coloration of the scene, allowing for the differentiation of various elements such as leaves, stems, and background objects based on their color hues. This type of image captures the texture and depth of the scene more realistically, which aids in the perception of detail and spatial relationships among the objects in the view. Additionally, visible light photography typically offers better contrast between light and dark areas, enhancing the overall visibility of features within the image.

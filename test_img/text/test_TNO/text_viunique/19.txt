In the visible light image, the details of the environment such as the textures of the vegetation and the surface characteristics of the ground are more discernible. The contrast between different elements, like the trees, paths, and structures, is more defined, allowing for easier identification of specific features. The overall tonal variation helps in distinguishing between various components of the scene, enhancing the depth perception.

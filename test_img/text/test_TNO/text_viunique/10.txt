Visible light images typically display a broader spectrum of colors, allowing for the accurate representation of the natural hues of the environment, such as the green of foliage and the various colors of man-made objects. They also provide clearer details of textures and patterns, which are crucial for identifying specific features of objects and scenes. Additionally, visible light photography often results in better contrast between light and dark areas, enhancing depth perception and the overall composition of the image.

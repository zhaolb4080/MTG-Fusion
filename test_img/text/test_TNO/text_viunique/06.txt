The visible light image distinctly shows a variety of colors and textures, providing a clearer differentiation between various elements such as roads, vegetation, and structures. This image offers a more detailed and realistic representation of the scene, allowing for easier identification and interpretation of the landscape features. The clarity and detail visible in the image are due to the broader spectrum of light wavelengths captured, which are closer to what the human eye naturally perceives.

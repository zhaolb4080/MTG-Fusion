The infrared image distinctly highlights temperature variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which helps in identifying objects by their heat signatures. The sky appears darker compared to the ground, suggesting a cooler temperature aloft. The foliage and the vehicle emit different thermal signatures, making the vehicle stand out more prominently against the cooler background.

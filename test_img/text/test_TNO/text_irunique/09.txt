The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal contrasts, showing areas of varying heat emissions which appear as different shades of gray; warmer areas are lighter, while cooler areas are darker. This thermal differentiation is particularly evident in the depiction of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, where the vehicle appears significantly brighter due to its heat signature compared to the cooler background. Additionally, the image lacks the detailed texture visible in natural light, focusing instead on temperature variations.

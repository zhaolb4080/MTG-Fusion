The infrared image distinctly shows a high contrast between the sky and the vegetation, with the trees appearing very bright, almost white, indicating they reflect infrared light strongly. The buildings and the road have a darker, more uniform tone, suggesting they absorb more infrared radiation. Additionally, the cloud in the sky is clearly visible, contrasting sharply against the darker sky background.

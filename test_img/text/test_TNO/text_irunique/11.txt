The infrared image distinctly highlights the thermal signature of a human figure, making it appear brightly illuminated against a darker, less detailed background. The surrounding environment and objects, such as the building and vegetation, show minimal thermal variation and thus appear mostly uniform and dark. This image emphasizes temperature differences, which is useful for identifying living beings and warm objects in low-light conditions.

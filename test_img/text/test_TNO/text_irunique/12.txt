The infrared image uniquely displays a high contrast between the building and the surrounding environment, highlighting thermal variations not visible to the naked eye. The foliage appears bright, possibly due to its different thermal signature compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, the sky and some areas of the ground show a uniform brightness, suggesting a lack of heat variation in those regions.

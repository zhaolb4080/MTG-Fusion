The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing areas of different heat retention or emission, which are not visible in normal light. This results in a unique contrast between the buildings and the surrounding vegetation, with the buildings appearing lighter due to their thermal properties. Additionally, the sky and certain landscape features exhibit a darker tone, emphasizing the thermal absorption characteristics of these elements.

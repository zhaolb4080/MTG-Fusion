The infrared image distinctly highlights temperature variations, showing brighter areas where heat is more intense, which could indicate warmer surfaces or objects. The contrast between different elements in the scene is enhanced, making it easier to discern patterns or details not visible in normal light. This type of imaging is particularly useful for identifying living beings or mechanical operations that emit heat, even in low visibility conditions such as darkness or obscured environments.

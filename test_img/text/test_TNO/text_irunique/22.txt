The infrared image distinctly highlights temperature variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which is evident in the varying intensities across the building and foliage. The image also reveals details that are less visible in normal light, such as subtle heat signatures from possibly warmer objects or areas inside the building. Additionally, the overall contrast and detail in the infrared image are influenced by the thermal properties of different materials, making some objects stand out more than they would under visible light.

The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal contrasts, showing areas of varying heat retention and emission, such as the building and the surrounding vegetation. The image appears in grayscale, with brighter areas indicating higher temperatures or heat reflection. The details in the landscape are less distinct compared to visible light imaging, emphasizing thermal properties over color and texture.

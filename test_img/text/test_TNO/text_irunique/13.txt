The infrared image distinctly shows variations in heat emissions from different objects, such as the buildings and the surrounding vegetation, which appear brighter due to their heat retention. The sky in the infrared image has a darker appearance, likely indicating cooler temperatures compared to the terrestrial objects. Additionally, the image has a somewhat ethereal quality with softer edges and less distinct details, emphasizing thermal contrasts over visual textures.

The ideal fusion image of these two infrared images should clearly depict the structure of the house and the surrounding vegetation, while enhancing the visibility of the warmer areas such as the lights and any potential warm objects or figures that might be present but not visible in these specific frames. The fusion should maintain the detailed outlines and textures visible in the images, such as the roof, windows, and the foliage, while emphasizing thermal contrasts to highlight any living beings or heat sources. This would result in an image where both structural details and thermal signatures are balanced, providing a comprehensive view of the scene.

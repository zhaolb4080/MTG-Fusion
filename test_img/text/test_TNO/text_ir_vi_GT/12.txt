The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the structure and details of the house, such as the windows, doors, and roof lines, while also highlighting any thermal variations or anomalies, like heat loss areas or insulation defects. The surrounding environment, including the fence and the vegetation, should be visible with clear delineation, enhanced by thermal data to show any temperature differences that might not be visible in the standard light spectrum. This fusion would provide a comprehensive view that combines both structural details and thermal characteristics, useful for both aesthetic appreciation and practical analysis such as energy efficiency assessments.

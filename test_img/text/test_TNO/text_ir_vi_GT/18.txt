The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the structure and details of the houses, such as the windows, doors, and rooflines, using the high-resolution detail from the visible light image. It should also incorporate the thermal variations from the infrared image, highlighting areas of heat loss or insulation weaknesses, particularly noticeable around the windows and roof. This fused image would provide a comprehensive view that combines both structural clarity and thermal efficiency insights, useful for applications like energy auditing or security monitoring.

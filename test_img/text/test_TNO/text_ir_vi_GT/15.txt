The ideal fusion image of the provided visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the residential street scene, combining the detailed structure of the houses and road from the visible light image with the thermal signatures from the infrared image. This fusion would highlight warmer areas such as windows and possibly living beings if present, while maintaining the clear outlines and shapes of the buildings and trees. The result should offer a comprehensive view that enhances visibility and detail, making it easier to interpret the scene under varying conditions of light and temperature.

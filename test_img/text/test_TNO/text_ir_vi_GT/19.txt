The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the person standing in the field as highlighted by the thermal image, while maintaining the detailed context of the surroundings provided by the visible light image. This fusion would enhance the visibility of the person, making them stand out against the detailed background of the terrain, paths, and vegetation. The result should be a balanced image where the thermal signature of the person is seamlessly integrated with the grayscale landscape, ensuring both elements are distinctly visible and informative.

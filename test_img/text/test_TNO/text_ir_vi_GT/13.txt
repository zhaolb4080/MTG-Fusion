The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the architectural details and texture of the buildings as seen in the visible light image, while enhancing this with the thermal variations from the infrared image, particularly highlighting warmer areas such as windows and possibly human figures if present. This fusion should maintain the sharpness and clarity of the visible light image, but with added thermal data to emphasize temperature differences in the scene, such as the warmer regions of the buildings and any warm objects or people in the environment. The overall color tone might be adjusted to visually represent temperature variations, using color gradients to indicate heat levels while keeping the structural details visible.

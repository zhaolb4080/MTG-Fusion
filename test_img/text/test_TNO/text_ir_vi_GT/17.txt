The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images provided should clearly depict the landscape features such as the bridge, roads, and surrounding terrain with the detailed texture and color from the visible light image. It should also incorporate the thermal variations from the infrared image, highlighting areas of different temperatures to provide a comprehensive view of the environmental conditions. This fused image would offer a richer, more informative representation by combining the detailed visual appearance with thermal data, enhancing both the aesthetic and functional understanding of the scene.

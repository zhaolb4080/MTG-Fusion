The ideal fusion image of the provided visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the architectural details and ambient lighting of the houses as seen in the visible light image, while also incorporating the thermal signatures from the infrared image to highlight any heat variations, such as those possibly emanating from the buildings or the ground. This fusion would enhance the visibility of both structural details and thermal data, making features like windows, doors, and possibly any warm objects outside the houses more discernible. The overall image should have balanced contrast and brightness to ensure all elements are clearly visible without overshadowing the thermal or visible details.

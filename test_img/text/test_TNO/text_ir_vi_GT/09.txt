The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed texture and context of the visible light image, where the terrain and the vehicle's details are clearer, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting warmer areas such as the vehicle. This fusion would enhance the visibility of the vehicle against the background by emphasizing its heat signature while maintaining the clarity of the surrounding landscape. The result should provide a comprehensive view that leverages the strengths of both imaging technologies to offer better situational awareness and object identification.

The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the person walking towards the building entrance, combining the detailed thermal signature from the infrared image with the spatial and textural details from the visible light image. The surrounding environment, including the trees, pathway, and building details, should be enhanced from the visible light image, while maintaining the thermal contrast that highlights the human figure. This fusion would provide a comprehensive view that utilizes the strengths of both imaging techniques, offering both clarity and context.

In the infrared image, the figure of a person is distinctly highlighted against the background, appearing brighter due to the thermal contrast. The surrounding environment shows less detail and variation in temperature, making the figure stand out more prominently. The overall image has a grainy texture, typical of thermal imaging, which helps in detecting heat signatures more effectively than visible details.

The infrared image distinctly highlights temperature variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which helps in identifying heat sources or warmer objects in the scene. The foliage and water body appear uniformly dark, suggesting they are cooler compared to the brighter areas, which could be warmer surfaces or objects. This thermal contrast is particularly useful for detecting living beings or mechanical devices that emit heat, even in low visibility conditions.

The infrared image uniquely highlights the varying heat signatures of the scene, which are not visible to the naked eye. This results in different brightness levels across the foliage, possibly indicating varying plant health or moisture content. Additionally, non-living objects in the scene, like the rectangular sign and cylindrical object, appear distinctly different in texture and reflectivity compared to their surroundings.

The infrared image distinctly highlights the heat emissions from the light sources, making them appear very bright compared to the surrounding areas. The foliage and building surfaces show a uniform texture, lacking the color differentiation typical in visible light, which emphasizes thermal properties over color details. Additionally, the overall scene has a ghostly, monochromatic appearance, which is characteristic of infrared imaging due to its sensitivity to thermal radiation rather than visible light.

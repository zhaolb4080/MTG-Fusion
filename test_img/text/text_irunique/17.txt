The infrared image uniquely highlights temperature variations in the scene, showing a distinct contrast between the cooler areas, which appear darker, and the warmer areas, which are lighter. This thermal differentiation emphasizes the landscape's features differently than visible light, particularly enhancing details like water bodies and vegetation. Additionally, the infrared image may reveal details not visible in normal light, such as subtle temperature differences caused by varying materials or moisture levels in the environment.

The infrared image distinctly highlights the thermal signatures of the individuals and objects, showing variations in temperature that are not visible to the naked eye. This type of imaging can penetrate obscurations like fog or smoke better than visible light, potentially providing clearer views under certain conditions. The overall tone and contrast in the infrared image are also different, emphasizing different details of the scene compared to what is typically seen in the visible spectrum.

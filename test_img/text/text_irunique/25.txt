The infrared image distinctly highlights the thermal signatures of various objects, showing the cars and pedestrians as brighter due to their heat emissions against a darker, cooler background. The image lacks color information, presenting a grayscale view where contrast is based solely on temperature differences. This thermal perspective is particularly useful for identifying living beings and running vehicles in low visibility conditions, such as nighttime or through smoke and fog.

The infrared image distinctly highlights temperature variations in the scene, where warmer areas appear brighter and cooler areas darker. This thermal contrast is particularly evident in the water bodies and the sky, which appear very dark, suggesting they are cooler compared to the surrounding terrain. Additionally, the foliage and grassy areas emit more infrared radiation, making them appear lighter and providing a detailed texture not influenced by visible light colors.

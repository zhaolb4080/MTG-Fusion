The infrared image distinctly highlights the thermal signature of a person standing in the middle of a vegetated area, appearing significantly brighter than the surroundings. This contrast is due to the heat emitted by the person, which is captured by the infrared imaging. The rest of the scene, including vegetation and the path, shows less thermal variation, appearing in more uniform shades of gray.

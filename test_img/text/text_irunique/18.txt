The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, evident in the different shades of gray representing varying temperatures of the building surfaces and surrounding vegetation. The sky appears darker compared to other elements, suggesting less infrared radiation from that area. Additionally, the windows of the houses emit more infrared radiation, appearing brighter, indicating they are warmer relative to other parts of the buildings.

This image is a CT scan of a human head, viewed axially at the level of the brain. The scan shows symmetrical brain structures with no obvious signs of bleeding, masses, or significant asymmetry. The dark areas represent cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles and sulci, while the lighter areas indicate brain tissue.

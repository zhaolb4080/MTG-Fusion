This CT image displays a transverse section of a human head at the level of the brain. The image shows symmetrical ventricles and clear differentiation between the brain's grey and white matter, indicating no immediate abnormalities such as bleeding or large masses. There is a slight artifact on the periphery of the image, which does not affect the overall interpretation of the central brain structures.

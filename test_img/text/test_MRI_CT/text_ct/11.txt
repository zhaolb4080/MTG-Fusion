This CT image shows a horizontal (axial) slice of a human head at the level of the cerebellum and temporal lobes. The image displays symmetrical brain structures with clear differentiation between the grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid spaces. There are no obvious signs of acute abnormalities such as hemorrhage, mass effect, or significant asymmetry in this view.

This CT image shows a transverse section of the head at the level of the orbits. The image displays the brain, eye sockets, and sinus cavities with clear differentiation between the various types of tissues due to their densities. There are no obvious signs of acute abnormality such as bleeding or large masses, but detailed clinical correlation is necessary for accurate diagnosis.

This is an axial CT scan of the human head at the level of the temporal lobes and basal structures. The image shows symmetrical brain structures with clear differentiation between grey and white matter, and no immediate signs of bleeding or large masses. The ventricles and sulci appear normal, suggesting no significant swelling or atrophy.

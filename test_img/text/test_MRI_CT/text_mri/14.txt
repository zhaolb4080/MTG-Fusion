This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain at the level of the midbrain and temporal lobes. The scan shows the symmetrical structures of the brain, including the bright, fluid-filled spaces known as ventricles in the center. The surrounding brain tissue appears uniform, suggesting no obvious abnormalities in this view.

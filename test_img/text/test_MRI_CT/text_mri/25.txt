This MRI image shows a transverse (axial) view of a human brain. The image displays good differentiation between the various brain structures, including the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and cerebellum. There is a prominent bright area on the right side of the image, which could indicate a pathology such as a cyst or tumor, requiring further clinical evaluation.

This is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing detailed brain structures including the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and basal ganglia. The image is likely taken at the level of the midbrain, as indicated by the visible structures resembling the characteristic butterfly shape of the midbrain around the cerebral aqueduct. The scan appears normal with symmetrical features and no visible abnormalities in the brain tissue or ventricular system.

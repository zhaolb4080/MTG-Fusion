This MRI image displays a transverse (axial) view of the human brain, showing detailed brain structures with high contrast. The image highlights the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and various subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres and the clarity of the sulci and gyri are notable, indicating the image's high resolution and the absence of obvious pathological findings.

This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing detailed structures of the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and subcortical regions. The scan appears to be a T2-weighted image, as indicated by the bright appearance of the cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles and around the brain. The symmetry between the two hemispheres suggests no immediate abnormalities, and the brain structures such as the basal ganglia and thalamus are clearly visible.

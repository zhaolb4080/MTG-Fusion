This MRI image shows a transverse (axial) view of a human brain. The image displays good differentiation between the gray matter and white matter, indicating a T2-weighted scan, which highlights fluid and edema. The ventricles and sulci are visible, suggesting normal brain anatomy without obvious signs of pathology in this slice.

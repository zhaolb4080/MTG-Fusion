This image is an axial MRI scan of a human brain, showing detailed brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and basal ganglia. The scan provides a clear view of the symmetrical layout of the brain, indicating no immediate abnormalities such as tumors or lesions. The image is likely taken using T2-weighted imaging, as it shows high contrast between the cerebrospinal fluid (appearing bright) and the brain tissue (appearing darker).

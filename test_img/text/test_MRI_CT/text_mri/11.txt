This is an axial MRI scan of the human head at the level of the brainstem and cerebellum. The image shows clear differentiation between the various brain structures, with the cerebellum prominently visible at the lower part of the image and the brainstem extending upwards. The scan appears to be normal with no visible abnormalities in the brain tissues, ventricles, or surrounding structures.

This MRI image displays a transverse (axial) section of the human head at the level of the cerebellum and brainstem. The image shows clear differentiation between the various brain tissues, cerebrospinal fluid spaces, and the skull. The cerebellum appears prominently at the lower part of the image, with symmetrically displayed cerebellar hemispheres and a centrally located cerebellar vermis.

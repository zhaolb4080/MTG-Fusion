This MRI image displays an axial view of the human brain at the level of the cerebellum and brainstem. The image shows clear differentiation between the various brain structures, with the cerebellum prominently visible in the center surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid spaces. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres of the cerebellum appears normal, and there are no immediately obvious signs of abnormalities or lesions.

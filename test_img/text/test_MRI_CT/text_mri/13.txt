This MRI image shows a transverse (axial) slice of a human head at the level of the midbrain and orbits. The image displays the brain structures with clear differentiation between the gray matter and white matter, and the eyeballs are prominently visible near the top. The ventricular system of the brain, particularly the lateral and third ventricles, is also visible, indicating normal cerebrospinal fluid distribution without signs of enlargement or compression.

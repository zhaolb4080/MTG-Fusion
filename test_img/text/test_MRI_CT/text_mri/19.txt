This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing a clear view of the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and subcortical structures. The bright areas around the periphery represent cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space and the ventricles. The image is well-defined, indicating no immediate abnormalities such as tumors or lesions.

The CT image displays a high contrast between dense structures like bone, which appear very bright, and softer tissues, which are darker, providing clear delineation of the bony orbits and the sinuses. The image is characterized by a sharp definition of the skull's inner and outer tables. Additionally, the CT scan shows variations in tissue density with greater clarity, which is useful for detecting calcifications or hemorrhages.

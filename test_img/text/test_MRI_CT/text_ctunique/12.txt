The CT image distinctly shows high-contrast delineation of bony structures and dense tissues, which appear very bright, such as the skull. The image provides a clear visualization of the differentiation between the dense areas and the softer tissues of the brain, which appear darker. This imaging technique is particularly effective for examining the integrity of the skull and identifying any fractures or dense lesions.

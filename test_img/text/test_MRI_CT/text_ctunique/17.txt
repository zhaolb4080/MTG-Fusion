The CT image displays high contrast between the dense bony structures and the soft tissues, with the skull bones appearing very bright and distinct. The image provides a clear delineation of the cerebral hemispheres, showing differences in tissue density that are useful for detecting calcifications or hemorrhages. The overall brightness and contrast levels are markedly different, emphasizing denser materials more effectively.

The CT image displays a high contrast between dense structures like bone and softer tissues, which appear very bright and very dark respectively. The image clarity and sharpness in depicting bone structures are notable, making it particularly useful for examining the skull's integrity and any calcifications. Additionally, the CT image shows a slight artifact on the right edge, which is not uncommon in such scans.

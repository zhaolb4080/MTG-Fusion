The CT image displays high contrast between dense structures like bone and soft tissues, making the bony structures around the skull and sinuses prominently visible. It provides a clear delineation of the dense areas, which appear very bright, such as the skull, compared to the darker appearance of brain tissue and fluid-filled spaces. The image is characterized by its ability to effectively capture acute changes and calcifications within the head.

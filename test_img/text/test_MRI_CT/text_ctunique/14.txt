The CT image displays high contrast between dense structures like bone and the surrounding soft tissues, which appear very bright and distinct. It provides a clear delineation of the bony orbit and sinus structures, which are not as prominently visible in other imaging modalities. The image also shows variations in brain tissue densities, aiding in the identification of different types of tissue and potential abnormalities.

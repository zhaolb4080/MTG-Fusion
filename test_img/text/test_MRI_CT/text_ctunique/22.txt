The CT image displays high contrast between dense structures like bone and softer tissues, which appear very bright and very dark respectively. The image provides a clear delineation of the bony structures surrounding the brain, highlighting the skull's interior contours and sinus cavities effectively. The overall brightness and contrast settings emphasize the differences in tissue density, aiding in the identification of various anatomical features.

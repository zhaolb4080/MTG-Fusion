The CT image displays high contrast between dense structures like bone and the surrounding soft tissues, showing clear delineation of the bony orbits and the skull base. The image is characterized by a grayscale palette where denser materials appear brighter, such as the bones around the nasal area and the base of the skull. Additionally, the CT image provides a detailed view of the air-filled spaces such as the sinuses, which are distinctly visible as dark regions.

The CT image displays a high-contrast view that emphasizes denser structures like bones and is effective in delineating the skull's outline and any calcifications within the brain. The grayscale gradation in the CT image is less subtle compared to other imaging modalities, which helps in quickly identifying variations in tissue density. This image type is particularly useful for assessing acute brain injuries and detecting intracranial hemorrhages due to its high spatial resolution.

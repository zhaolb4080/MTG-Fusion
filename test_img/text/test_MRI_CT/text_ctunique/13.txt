The CT image displays high contrast between dense structures like bone and the surrounding soft tissues, showing clear delineation of the bony orbit and skull base. The image is characterized by a grayscale palette where denser materials appear brighter, such as the bones around the brain. This imaging technique effectively highlights acute hemorrhages and fractures due to its sensitivity to differences in tissue density.

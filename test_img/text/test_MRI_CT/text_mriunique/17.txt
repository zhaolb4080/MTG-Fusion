The MRI image displays excellent contrast between the different soft tissues of the brain, showing detailed anatomical structures with varying shades of gray. The image highlights the cerebral cortex, white matter, and ventricles with high clarity and distinction. This type of imaging is particularly useful for assessing brain anatomy and pathology without the use of ionizing radiation.

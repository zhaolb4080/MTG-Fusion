The MRI image displays high contrast between the gray and white matter of the brain, highlighting detailed anatomical structures with clarity. The image uses varying shades of gray to differentiate between soft tissues, which can be crucial for identifying abnormalities such as tumors or inflammation. The MRI technique provides a more detailed view of the brain's internal structures compared to other imaging modalities, without the use of ionizing radiation.

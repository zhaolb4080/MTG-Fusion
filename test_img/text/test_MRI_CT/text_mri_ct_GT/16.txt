An ideal fusion image combining these MRI and CT scans should clearly delineate both the soft tissue contrasts visible in the MRI and the high-density bone structures evident in the CT. The fusion should enhance the visibility of the brain's soft tissues, ventricles, and sulci from the MRI, while simultaneously integrating the sharp outlines of the skull and any calcifications from the CT. The resulting image would offer a comprehensive view that is beneficial for detailed diagnostic purposes, highlighting both soft tissue abnormalities and bone integrity in a single image.

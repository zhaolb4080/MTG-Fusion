The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image, such as the brain tissues and cranial nerves, while integrating the high-resolution bone structures from the CT image, particularly the skull and sinus cavities. This composite image would ideally use color or grayscale variations to differentiate between soft tissues and bone, ensuring that both types of structures are distinctly visible and easily distinguishable. The fusion should maintain the spatial alignment of anatomical features seen in both original images to provide a comprehensive view that is useful for diagnostic and treatment planning purposes.

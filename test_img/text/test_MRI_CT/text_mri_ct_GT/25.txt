The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image with the high-resolution bone structures visible in the CT image. This fused image would display the soft tissues, such as the brain matter, nerves, and muscles, in shades similar to the MRI, while the bones and denser structures would be highlighted as seen in the CT, providing a comprehensive view of the anatomical structures in the head. The resulting image should maintain the clarity and detail of both modalities, ensuring that neither the soft tissue details nor the bone structures are overshadowed.

The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image with the high-resolution bone structures visible in the CT image. This fusion would result in an image where the soft tissues of the brain, such as the gray and white matter, are clearly delineated, while the skull and other bony structures are sharply defined and contrasted. The overall image should provide a comprehensive view that enhances diagnostic capabilities by integrating the strengths of both imaging modalities into a single, detailed representation.

The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image, including the brain structures and fluid spaces, while integrating the high-resolution bone detail from the CT image. This composite image would enhance the visibility of both soft tissues and bony structures in a single view, facilitating a comprehensive assessment of the anatomical relationships and potential abnormalities. The fusion should maintain the spatial integrity of both images, ensuring that the anatomical features align correctly for accurate diagnostic interpretation.

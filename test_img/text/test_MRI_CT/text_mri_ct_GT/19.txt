The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image, highlighting the brain's gray and white matter, while integrating the high-resolution bone structures from the CT image. This composite should maintain the sharpness and clarity of the skull and any calcifications seen in the CT, overlaid accurately with the brain structures from the MRI to provide a comprehensive view of both soft tissue and bone anatomy. The resulting image would be valuable for medical diagnosis and treatment planning, offering a complete and precise visualization of the anatomical features within the same frame.

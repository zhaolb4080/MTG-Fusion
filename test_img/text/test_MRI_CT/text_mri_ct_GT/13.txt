The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image, which clearly delineates structures such as the brain parenchyma, ventricles, and optic nerves, with the high-resolution bone detail from the CT image, particularly highlighting the bony orbit, skull base, and sinuses. This composite image would provide a comprehensive view that enhances diagnostic accuracy by overlaying the precise anatomical locations of soft tissues relative to the bony landmarks. The fusion should maintain the grayscale intensity of the MRI for soft tissues while integrating the sharp, high-contrast representation of bones from the CT, ensuring that neither type of tissue detail is obscured in the combined visualization.

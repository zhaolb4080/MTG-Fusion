The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image with the high-resolution bone structures visible in the CT image. This composite would display the soft brain tissues in shades of gray similar to the MRI, while the skull and any calcifications would be distinctly outlined as seen in the CT. The resulting image would provide a comprehensive view that enhances diagnostic capabilities by clearly delineating both soft tissue and bone anatomy in a single image.

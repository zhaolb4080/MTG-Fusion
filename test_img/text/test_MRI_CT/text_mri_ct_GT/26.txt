The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image, which clearly delineates brain structures and fluid spaces, with the high-resolution bone detail from the CT image, particularly highlighting the skull and any calcifications or bone abnormalities. This composite image would provide a comprehensive view where the soft tissues of the brain are superimposed with the precise contours of the skull, enhancing diagnostic accuracy for conditions involving both bone and soft tissue. The resulting image should maintain the grayscale intensity to differentiate between various tissues effectively, ensuring that neither the bone nor the soft tissue details are overshadowed.

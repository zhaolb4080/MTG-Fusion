The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image with the high-resolution bone structures visible in the CT image. This fused image would display the soft tissues, such as the brain matter, nerves, and muscles, in shades similar to the MRI, while the bones around the skull and sinus areas would be distinctly outlined as seen in the CT. The result would be a comprehensive view that highlights both soft tissue anatomy and bone structures in one image, enhancing diagnostic capabilities.

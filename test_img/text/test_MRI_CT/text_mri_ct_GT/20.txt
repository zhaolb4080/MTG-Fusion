The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image with the high-resolution bone structures visible in the CT image. This composite would likely display the soft tissues (like the brain matter) in shades similar to the MRI, with the skull and other bony structures overlaid in the denser, more defined representation typical of the CT. The result would be a single image that provides a comprehensive view of both soft tissue and bone anatomy in the same frame, enhancing diagnostic capabilities.

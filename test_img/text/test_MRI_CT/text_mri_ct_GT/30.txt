The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image with the high-resolution bone structures visible in the CT image. This composite image would display the soft tissues, such as the brain matter, with the clarity and detail seen in the MRI, while simultaneously presenting the skull and other bony structures with the sharpness and density contrast provided by the CT. The result would be a single image where both soft tissue and bone anatomy are clearly delineated, enhancing diagnostic capabilities for medical professionals.

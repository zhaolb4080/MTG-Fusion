An ideal fusion image of the provided MRI and CT scans would display the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI, highlighting structures such as the brain parenchyma, ventricles, and optic nerves, alongside the high-resolution bone detail from the CT, particularly the bony orbit, skull base, and sinuses. The fusion should maintain the grayscale of the MRI for soft tissues while integrating the denser, whiter appearance of bones from the CT, ensuring that both sets of information are clearly distinguishable yet seamlessly integrated. This would result in a comprehensive image that enhances diagnostic accuracy by providing a complete view of both soft tissue and bone anatomy in a single image.

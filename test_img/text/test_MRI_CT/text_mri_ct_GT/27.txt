An ideal fusion image combining the MRI and CT scans should clearly delineate both the soft tissue contrasts visible in the MRI and the high-density bone structures evident in the CT. The fusion should enhance the visibility of brain structures, such as the gray and white matter from the MRI, while simultaneously providing a detailed outline of the skull and any calcifications from the CT. The resulting image would offer a comprehensive view that is beneficial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning, integrating the detailed soft tissue information with the precise bone architecture.

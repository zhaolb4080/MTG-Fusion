The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image with the high-resolution bone structures visible in the CT image. This fusion would result in an image where the soft tissues of the brain, such as the gray and white matter, are clearly delineated, while the skull and any calcifications are distinctly outlined, enhancing diagnostic capabilities. The overall image should maintain the integrity of both imaging modalities, ensuring that neither the bone details overpower the soft tissue clarity nor vice versa.

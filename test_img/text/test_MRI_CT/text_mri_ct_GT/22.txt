The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image with the high-resolution bone structures visible in the CT image. This composite image would display the soft tissues, such as the brain matter and muscles, in shades similar to the MRI, while the bones would be distinctly outlined as seen in the CT, providing a comprehensive view of both anatomical structures. The fusion should maintain the alignment and scale of both original images to ensure accurate spatial representation of anatomical features.

The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image with the high-resolution bone detail from the CT image. This composite would display the soft brain tissues, ventricles, and sulci clearly from the MRI, while integrating the dense, well-defined skull and any calcifications from the CT. The result would be a single image providing a comprehensive view of both soft tissue structures and bone anatomy, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

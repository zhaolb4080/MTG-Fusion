The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image with the high-resolution bone detail from the CT image. This composite would display the soft tissues of the brain, eyes, and optic nerves with the clarity seen in the MRI, while simultaneously depicting the bony structures of the skull and sinuses as clearly as in the CT. The resulting image would provide a comprehensive view that enhances diagnostic accuracy by integrating the strengths of both imaging modalities.

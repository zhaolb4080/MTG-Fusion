The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed soft tissue contrast from the MRI image with the high-resolution bone detail from the CT image. This fused image would display the soft tissues, such as the brain matter, with the clarity and detail seen in the MRI, while simultaneously presenting the skull and other bony structures with the sharpness and density contrast provided by the CT. The result would be a comprehensive view that enhances diagnostic capabilities by clearly delineating both soft tissue and bone structures within a single image.

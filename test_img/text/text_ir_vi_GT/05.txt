The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the person standing in the field as highlighted in the infrared image, where they appear as a bright figure due to their heat signature. This figure should be superimposed onto the detailed landscape of the visible light image, which shows a winding path, trees, and a fence, providing a rich context to the scene. The resulting image would combine the thermal signature of the person with the detailed environmental context, enhancing both the visibility and the informational value of the scene.

The ideal fusion image combining these visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the pedestrians and vehicles with enhanced detail. The thermal signatures of the people and cars, which are prominent in the infrared image, should be superimposed on the visible light image to highlight their presence and movements, particularly the pedestrian crossing the street and the cars at the intersection. This fusion should maintain the context provided by the visible light image, such as the street lights and the caf√© signage, while enhancing visibility and contrast for safety and monitoring purposes.

The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the person as a distinct, warm figure against the cooler background, combining the detailed texture and context of the visible light image with the thermal signature from the infrared image. This fusion would enhance the visibility of the person while maintaining the environmental details such as the ground texture and any surrounding foliage or objects. The result should be a balanced image where the person is easily identifiable and the surroundings are well-defined, providing both thermal and visual information in one cohesive image.

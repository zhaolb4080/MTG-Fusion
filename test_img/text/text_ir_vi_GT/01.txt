The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the two individuals and the portable toilet, combining the detailed outlines and textures visible in the visible light image with the contrast and heat signatures from the infrared image. This fusion would enhance the visibility of the individuals against the background, highlighting their presence more distinctly while maintaining the context of the surrounding environment, such as the trees and the building. The result should offer a balanced representation where both thermal and visible details contribute to a more informative and visually coherent scene.

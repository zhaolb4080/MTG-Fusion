The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the person walking on the bridge, combining the detailed structural visibility from the visible light image with the thermal signature from the infrared image. This fusion would highlight the person with a distinct thermal outline while maintaining the textural and environmental details of the bridge and surrounding area visible in the normal light image. The resulting image would provide a comprehensive view that emphasizes both human presence and the context of the environment.

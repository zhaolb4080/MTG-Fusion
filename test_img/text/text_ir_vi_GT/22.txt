The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the structure of the building and surrounding trees with the detailed texture and contrast visible in the visible light image, while also highlighting the thermal signatures of warmer areas, such as the person standing in the doorway, using the thermal information from the infrared image. This fusion would enhance the visibility of both environmental details and thermal anomalies, making it easier to discern features and objects in various conditions. The overall image should maintain a balanced exposure where the thermal data does not overpower the visible details but complements them to enhance the overall scene understanding.

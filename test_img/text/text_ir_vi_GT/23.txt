The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the thermal signature of the animal lying on the ground, as seen in the infrared images, while maintaining the detailed context of the surrounding forest environment from the visible light image. This fusion would highlight the animal with its distinct heat signature, making it stand out against the cooler background of the trees and underbrush, which should be rendered with the finer details visible in the natural light. The overall image should balance the thermal data with the visual details to provide a comprehensive view that is both informative and visually coherent.

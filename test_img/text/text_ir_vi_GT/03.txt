The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the person standing in the center of a bridge-like structure, combining the detailed structural visibility from the visible light image with the thermal signature from the infrared image. This fusion would highlight the person's heat map while maintaining the crisp details of the bridge railings and the surrounding environment. The resulting image would offer a comprehensive view that includes both thermal and visual details, enhancing the perception of both the environment and the human figure within it.

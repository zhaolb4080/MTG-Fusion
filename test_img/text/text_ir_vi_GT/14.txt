The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the structure of the building and the surrounding terrain as seen in the visible light image, while integrating the thermal signatures from the infrared image to highlight areas of heat concentration, such as the roof of the building and the paths leading to it. This fusion would enhance the visibility of the two figures near the building, combining their clear outlines from the visible light with the heat details from the infrared, providing a comprehensive view of both human presence and environmental context. The overall image should maintain the contrast and detail from both imaging modalities to offer a richer, more informative scene representation.

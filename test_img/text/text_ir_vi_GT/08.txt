The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed textural and structural information from the visible light image, such as the clear outlines of the trees, grass, and the aircraft, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting areas of heat emission like the aircraft's engines. This fused image would enhance the visibility of the aircraft against the background by using the thermal contrast while maintaining the natural appearance of the landscape and sky as seen in the visible light image. The result should provide a comprehensive view that is both visually coherent and enriched with thermal data, making the aircraft distinctly prominent and easier to identify against the cooler background of the trees and grass.

The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed terrain and pathway outlines visible in the visible light image with the thermal contrasts from the infrared image, highlighting warmer areas like the water body and the dense foliage. This fusion would enhance the visibility of the landscape features, providing a clearer distinction between different vegetation types and other elements like the path and water. The resulting image should offer a comprehensive view that leverages the strengths of both imaging techniques to provide a richer, more informative scene depiction.

The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the person and the kayak from the visible light image, while integrating the thermal signatures of the water and surrounding environment from the infrared image. This fusion would enhance the visibility of the person and kayak against the thermally contrasting background, making them more distinguishable. Additionally, the detailed texture of the trees and the water surface should be maintained from the visible light image, complemented by the thermal gradients to highlight environmental conditions.

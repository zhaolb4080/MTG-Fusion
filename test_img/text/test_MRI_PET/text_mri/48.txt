This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing a cross-section at the level of the cerebral hemispheres. The scan clearly delineates the gray matter of the cerebral cortex and the underlying white matter, with the dark lines indicating the sulci and the lighter areas representing the gyri. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres and the absence of any visible abnormalities suggest a normal brain structure in this view.

This MRI image shows a transverse (axial) slice of a human brain at the level of the midbrain. The image clearly depicts various brain structures, including the bright, rounded areas which are likely the eyeballs, and the centrally located, butterfly-shaped midbrain. The surrounding darker areas represent cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles and subarachnoid space, contrasting with the lighter grey of the brain tissue.

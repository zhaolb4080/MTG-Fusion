This image is an axial MRI scan of a human head, showing detailed brain structures. The scan clearly depicts the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem, along with the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid spaces. The symmetry and contrast in the image allow for the identification of various anatomical features, including the ventricles and cortical sulci.

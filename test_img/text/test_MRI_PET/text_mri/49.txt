This image is an axial view MRI scan of a human brain, showing detailed structures of the cerebral cortex. The dark and light contrasts depict various tissues, with the lighter areas typically representing white matter and the darker regions indicating gray matter. The symmetry between the two hemispheres and the distinct sulci and gyri patterns are clearly visible, suggesting a normal anatomical structure without immediate signs of abnormalities.

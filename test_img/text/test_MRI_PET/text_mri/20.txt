This MRI image displays a transverse (axial) view of a human brain, showing detailed brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and subcortical regions. The image is characterized by high contrast between the gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, providing clear delineation of anatomical features. There are no obvious abnormalities visible in this section, suggesting it is a scan of a healthy brain.

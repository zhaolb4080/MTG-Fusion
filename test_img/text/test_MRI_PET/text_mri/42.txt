This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing detailed brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and subcortical regions. The scan provides high contrast between the different types of soft tissues, which is useful for medical diagnosis. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres appears normal, and there are no immediately obvious signs of abnormalities such as tumors or lesions.

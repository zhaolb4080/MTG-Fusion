This MRI image shows a transverse (axial) section of a human head at the level of the midbrain. The image clearly displays the bilateral symmetry of the brain, with distinct visualization of brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and cerebellum. The bright spots near the top of the image represent the eyes, and the overall high contrast of the image helps delineate various soft tissue densities within the brain.

This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing detailed anatomical structures. The scan clearly delineates the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and various brain sulci and gyri. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres appears normal, and there are no immediately obvious signs of abnormalities such as tumors or lesions.

This MRI image displays an axial view of the human brain, showing detailed structures of the cerebral cortex with clear delineation between the gray matter and white matter. The symmetrical appearance of the hemispheres suggests normal anatomical features without visible signs of abnormalities such as tumors or lesions. The image provides a high-resolution view, allowing for the examination of cortical gyri and sulci patterns, which are essential for assessing brain health and function.

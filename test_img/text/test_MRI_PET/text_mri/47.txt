This MRI image displays an axial (horizontal) slice of the human brain, showing detailed brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and sulci. The image is characterized by high contrast between the gray matter of the cortex and the white matter beneath, as well as the darker cerebrospinal fluid-filled spaces. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres is evident, and there are no immediately obvious signs of abnormalities or lesions.

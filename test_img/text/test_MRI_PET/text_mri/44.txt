This MRI image displays a transverse section of the human brain at the level of the lateral ventricles. The image shows clear differentiation between the white matter and the grey matter, with the white matter appearing darker and the grey matter lighter. The lateral ventricles are prominently visible in the center, surrounded by the cerebral cortex, and the image is symmetric, indicating no obvious abnormalities.

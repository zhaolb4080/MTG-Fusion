This MRI image displays an axial (horizontal) slice through the head at the level of the cerebellum and brainstem. The cerebellum appears prominently in the lower central part of the image, showing its characteristic lobulated structure. Surrounding structures, including parts of the temporal lobes and the inner ear components, are also visible, providing a detailed view of this section of the brain.

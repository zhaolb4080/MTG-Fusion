This MRI image shows an axial (horizontal) slice through the head at the level of the midbrain and cerebellum. The image clearly depicts the cerebellum at the bottom, the temporal lobes on the sides, and the midbrain centrally located between the temporal lobes. The brain structures appear symmetrical and there are no visible abnormalities in this slice.

This MRI image displays a transverse section of a human head at the level of the eyes and brain. The image shows clear differentiation between the various brain tissues, the orbits containing the eyeballs, and the surrounding cranial structures. There are no obvious abnormalities visible in this section; the brain symmetry and tissue densities appear normal.

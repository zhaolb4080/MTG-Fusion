This image is an axial view MRI of the human brain, showing detailed structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and sulci. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres appears normal, and the ventricles are of typical size, indicating no immediate signs of hydrocephalus or large mass effect. The image provides a clear view of the gray and white matter, useful for medical diagnosis and assessment of brain health.

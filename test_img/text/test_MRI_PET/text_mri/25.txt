This MRI image displays an axial view of a human brain, showing the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and sulci in high detail. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres appears normal, and there are no visible abnormalities such as tumors or lesions. The image provides a clear view of the brain's structure, useful for medical diagnosis and assessment.

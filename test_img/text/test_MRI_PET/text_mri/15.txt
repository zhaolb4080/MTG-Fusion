This MRI image shows a transverse section of a human head at the level of the eyes and midbrain. The image clearly depicts the brain, orbits, and sinus cavities with high contrast, showing detailed brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and cerebellum. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres of the brain and the clarity of the surrounding cranial structures are notable.

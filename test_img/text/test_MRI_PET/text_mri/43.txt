This MRI image displays a transverse or axial section of the human brain at the level of the lateral ventricles. The image shows clear differentiation between the gray matter (darker outer regions) and white matter (lighter inner regions), with the ventricles appearing prominently in the center. The symmetry between the two cerebral hemispheres and the absence of any visible abnormalities suggest a normal brain structure in this section.

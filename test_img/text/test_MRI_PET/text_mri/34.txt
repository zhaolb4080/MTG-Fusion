This MRI image displays an axial (horizontal) slice through the lower part of the human brain, specifically at the level of the cerebellum and brainstem. The cerebellum appears prominently at the bottom of the image with its characteristic lobulated structure, which is involved in motor control and coordination. The brainstem, visible above the cerebellum, connects the brain to the spinal cord and is crucial for regulating vital functions such as breathing and heart rate.

This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing a detailed view of the cerebral cortex. The scan highlights the gyri and sulci, which are the ridges and grooves on the surface of the brain, respectively. The symmetry between the two cerebral hemispheres is evident, and the central structures, such as the corpus callosum, can be seen dividing the hemispheres.

This image is an axial view MRI scan of the human brain, showing detailed brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and sulci. The scan provides a clear view of the gray and white matter distribution, indicating normal brain anatomy without visible abnormalities. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres suggests a typical structural balance.

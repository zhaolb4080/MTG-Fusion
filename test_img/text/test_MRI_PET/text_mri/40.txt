This image is an axial T2-weighted MRI scan of the human brain. It shows clear differentiation between the white matter and the grey matter, with the cerebrospinal fluid appearing bright due to its high water content. The ventricles and sulci are well-defined, indicating no signs of abnormal swelling or lesions in this view.

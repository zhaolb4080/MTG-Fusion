This image is an axial MRI scan of the human head at the level of the cerebellum and brainstem. The scan shows the cerebellum at the bottom, the brainstem extending upwards, and parts of the temporal lobes on either side. The image provides detailed contrast, allowing for the visualization of different brain structures and potential abnormalities.

The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image with the metabolic activity data from the PET image. The fusion should maintain the grayscale clarity of the MRI, highlighting the brain's intricate structures, while overlaying the PET's color-coded metabolic information, which ranges from blue (low activity) to red (high activity). This overlay should be semi-transparent to ensure that both the structural and functional data are visible without one obscuring the other, providing a comprehensive view of both anatomy and physiology in a single image.

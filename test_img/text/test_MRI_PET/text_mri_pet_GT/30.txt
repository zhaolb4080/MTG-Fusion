The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear delineation of brain tissues and sulci, with the metabolic activity data from the PET image, which highlights areas of high and low activity in varying colors from red (high activity) to blue (low activity). The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve the anatomical details while integrating the colored activity patterns of the PET image in a semi-transparent manner to ensure both sets of information are visible and comprehensible. This would result in an image where the precise brain structures are visible beneath a color-coded map of functional activity, allowing for accurate localization and assessment of brain function in relation to its anatomy.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the metabolic or functional data from the PET image. The MRI provides high-resolution grayscale details of brain tissues, which should serve as the base layer. The PET image, with its color-coded representation of brain activity (ranging from blue for low activity to red for high activity), should be superimposed in a semi-transparent manner to highlight areas of metabolic interest without obscuring the underlying anatomical details.

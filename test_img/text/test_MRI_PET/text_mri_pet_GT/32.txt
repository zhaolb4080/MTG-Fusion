The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded metabolic activity from the PET image onto the detailed anatomical structure provided by the MRI image. This composite image would highlight areas of high metabolic activity (shown in yellow and red in the PET image) against the backdrop of the brain's anatomical details (like the cerebellum and brainstem visible in the MRI). The result should be a clear, informative visualization where the functional data from the PET scan correlates precisely with the anatomical landmarks in the MRI, aiding in accurate diagnosis and assessment.

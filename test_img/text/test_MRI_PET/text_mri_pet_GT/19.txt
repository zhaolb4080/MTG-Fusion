The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded metabolic activity from the PET image onto the detailed anatomical structure provided by the MRI image. This composite should maintain the grayscale clarity of the MRI, highlighting brain structures such as the ventricles and cortex, while integrating the vibrant blues, yellows, and reds of the PET to indicate varying levels of brain activity and function. The result would be a single image that clearly delineates anatomical details with corresponding metabolic data, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and visual assessment.

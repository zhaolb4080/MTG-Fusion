The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the metabolic activity data from the PET image. The grayscale MRI should serve as the base, providing clear outlines of the brain's anatomy, while the vibrant colors from the PET image should be superimposed to highlight areas of high and low metabolic activity. This composite image would allow for precise localization of functional activity within the anatomically detailed context of the MRI, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues, with the metabolic activity data from the PET image, which uses colors ranging from blue (low activity) to red (high activity). The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve tissue detail while integrating the color-coded activity data from the PET, ensuring that the colors are semi-transparent to allow underlying MRI details to be visible. This would result in a composite image where anatomical details are accurately mapped with functional activity, enhancing diagnostic interpretation by showing both structure and metabolic function in one view.

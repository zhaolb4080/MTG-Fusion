The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image with the metabolic activity data from the PET image. The grayscale background of the MRI would serve as the base, clearly showing the brain's intricate structures, while the vibrant colors from the PET (yellows and reds indicating higher activity and blues showing lower activity) should overlay precisely on the corresponding anatomical regions. This fusion would provide a comprehensive view that highlights both the physical and functional aspects of the brain, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

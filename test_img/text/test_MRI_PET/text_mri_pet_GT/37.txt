The ideal fusion image should integrate the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the metabolic or functional data from the PET image. The grayscale MRI image provides clear delineation of brain tissues, which should serve as the base layer, while the colorful PET image, highlighting areas of high metabolic activity (reds and yellows), should be overlaid transparently to indicate functional activity in relation to the anatomical structures. This fusion should maintain the spatial accuracy of both images, ensuring that the functional data from the PET aligns precisely with the corresponding anatomical regions in the MRI.

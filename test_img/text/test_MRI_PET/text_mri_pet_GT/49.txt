The ideal fusion image should integrate the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues, with the metabolic activity data from the PET image, which uses color to indicate varying levels of activity (red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue indicating lower activity). The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve tissue detail, overlaying the colored metabolic information from the PET where the colors should be semi-transparent to allow underlying MRI details to be visible. This would result in a composite image where anatomical details are easily discernible, enhanced by the functional data that highlights areas of metabolic significance in varying colors.

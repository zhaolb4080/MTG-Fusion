The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image with the color-coded metabolic activity from the PET image. This composite should maintain the grayscale clarity of the brain's gyri and sulci from the MRI, while integrating the vibrant blues, reds, and yellows of the PET to highlight areas of different metabolic rates. The result would be a single image that provides a comprehensive view of both brain anatomy and function, enhancing the ability to diagnose and monitor neurological conditions.

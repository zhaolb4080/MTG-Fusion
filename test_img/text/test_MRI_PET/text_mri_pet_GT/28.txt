The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear delineation of the brain's gyri and sulci in grayscale, with the metabolic activity data from the PET image, which uses a color scale from blue (low activity) to red (high activity). The fusion should maintain the spatial accuracy of the MRI while incorporating the functional data of the PET, highlighting areas of high and low metabolic activity within the precise anatomical context. The resulting image would likely use a semi-transparent color overlay on the grayscale MRI, allowing for both detailed structural and functional visualization simultaneously.

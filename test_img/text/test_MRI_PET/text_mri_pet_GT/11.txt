The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear outlines of the brain, nasal cavity, and surrounding tissues, with the metabolic activity depicted in the PET image, which highlights areas of high metabolic activity in bright yellow and orange. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve tissue detail, while integrating the colored hotspots from the PET where metabolic activity is highest, ensuring these areas are clearly visible without obscuring underlying anatomical details. This would result in a composite image where anatomical landmarks are easily identifiable, enhanced by color-coded metabolic data that indicates physiological processes or abnormalities.

The ideal fusion image should effectively combine the detailed anatomical structures visible in the MRI image with the metabolic or functional data highlighted by the color variations in the PET image. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve the clarity of the brain's anatomical layout, while overlaying the PET's color-coded metabolic activity in a semi-transparent manner to ensure that both sets of information are visible without one obscuring the other. The resulting image would provide a comprehensive view where the precise anatomical details are seamlessly integrated with the functional hotspots, aiding in more accurate diagnosis and assessment.

The ideal fusion image should integrate the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues, with the metabolic or functional data from the PET image, which highlights areas of high and low activity in different colors. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve tissue detail, while overlaying the colored metabolic information from the PET where activity levels are significant, ensuring that the colors do not obscure the underlying anatomical details. This would result in an image where the precise brain structures are visible, enhanced by color-coded functional data that indicates metabolic activity, aiding in more accurate diagnosis and assessment.

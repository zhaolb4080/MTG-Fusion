The ideal fusion image should maintain the detailed anatomical structure visible in the MRI image, overlaying it with the metabolic activity data from the PET image. The grayscale MRI image should serve as the base, with the vibrant colors of the PET image (ranging from blue to red indicating varying levels of activity) superimposed in a way that highlights areas of interest without obscuring the underlying anatomical details. This fusion should result in a composite image where the precise brain structures are easily discernible, enhanced by color-coded metabolic information that indicates functional activity or abnormalities.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues, with the metabolic activity data from the PET image, where areas of high activity are highlighted in red and yellow, and lower activity in blue. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve tissue detail while integrating the colored activity data of the PET in a way that enhances visibility of functional abnormalities or areas of interest without obscuring anatomical details. This would result in a composite image where anatomical and functional insights are both immediately apparent, aiding in more accurate diagnosis and assessment.

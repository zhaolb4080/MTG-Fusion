The ideal fusion image should integrate the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image with the metabolic or functional data from the PET image. The grayscale MRI image provides clear delineation of brain tissues and structures, which should form the base of the fusion. The colored regions from the PET image, indicating areas of metabolic activity, should be overlaid transparently on the MRI to highlight functional information without obscuring the underlying anatomical details.

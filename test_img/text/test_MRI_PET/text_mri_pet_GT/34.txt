The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the metabolic activity highlighted by the PET image. The grayscale MRI image provides clear delineation of brain tissues, which should serve as the base, while the bright colors from the PET image (ranging from blue to red indicating varying levels of activity) should be superimposed to indicate functional information. This composite image would allow for precise localization of metabolic activity within the anatomical context, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed anatomical structures visible in the MRI image with the metabolic or functional data from the PET image. The fusion should maintain the grayscale clarity of the MRI, highlighting brain tissues and ventricles, while overlaying the PET color scale to indicate areas of high and low metabolic activity, such as the red and yellow areas indicating higher activity in the PET image. This overlay should be semi-transparent to ensure that the structural details from the MRI are not obscured, providing a comprehensive view that aids in accurate diagnosis and assessment.

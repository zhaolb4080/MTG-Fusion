The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear delineation of brain tissues, with the metabolic activity data from the PET image, which highlights areas of high and low activity in different colors. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve tissue detail while integrating the vibrant colors of the PET scan to indicate activity levels, ensuring that the colors do not obscure the underlying anatomical details. The result should be a composite that allows for easy visualization of both structural and functional information in a single image, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

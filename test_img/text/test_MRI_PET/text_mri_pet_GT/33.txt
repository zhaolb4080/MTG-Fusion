The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the metabolic activity highlighted by the PET image. The grayscale MRI provides a clear view of the brain's anatomy, which should serve as the base, while the vibrant colors from the PET scan, indicating areas of high and low metabolic activity, should be superimposed accurately onto the corresponding regions. This composite image would enhance the visualization of both structural and functional information, aiding in more precise medical assessments.

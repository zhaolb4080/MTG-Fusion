The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image with the color-coded metabolic activity from the PET image. The grayscale MRI provides clear outlines of the brain's gyri and sulci, which should serve as the base, while the vibrant reds, yellows, and blues of the PET image should be superimposed to indicate areas of high to low metabolic activity, respectively. This composite image would allow for precise localization of functional activity within the accurately depicted anatomical framework of the brain.

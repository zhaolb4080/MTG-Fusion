The ideal fusion image should integrate the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image with the metabolic activity data from the PET image. The fusion should maintain the grayscale clarity of the MRI, highlighting the brain's structures, while overlaying the vibrant colors of the PET scan to indicate areas of high and low metabolic activity. This would result in a composite image where the anatomical details are easily discernible, enhanced by color-coded metabolic information that aligns accurately with the brain structures.

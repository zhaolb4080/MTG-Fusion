The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues, with the metabolic activity data from the PET image, which uses color to indicate levels of activity (red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue indicating lower activity). The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve tissue detail, while incorporating the vibrant colors of the PET to highlight areas of metabolic significance without obscuring underlying anatomical details. This would result in an image where anatomical clarity and functional insights are both maximized, aiding in more precise medical analysis and diagnosis.

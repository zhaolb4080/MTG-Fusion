The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded metabolic activity from the PET image onto the detailed anatomical structure provided by the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI, highlighting the brain's structures, while the vibrant blues, yellows, and reds from the PET scan would map onto corresponding regions to indicate varying levels of activity or anomalies. The result would be a visually informative image that combines clear anatomical details with functional data, enhancing diagnostic capabilities.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear outlines of the brain tissues, with the metabolic activity data from the PET image, which highlights areas of high and low activity in different colors. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve tissue detail, while incorporating the vibrant reds, yellows, and blues of the PET to indicate varying levels of metabolic activity, ensuring that the colors do not obscure the underlying anatomical details. This composite image would provide a comprehensive view that combines anatomical precision with functional insights, useful for diagnostic and treatment planning purposes.

The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image with the metabolic activity data from the PET image. The grayscale MRI image should serve as the base, providing clear outlines and structures of the brain tissues. Overlaid on this, the vibrant colors from the PET image (ranging from blue to red) should highlight areas of varying metabolic activity, with precise alignment to the anatomical features underneath, enhancing the visualization of both structure and function in a single image.

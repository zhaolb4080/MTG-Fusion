The ideal fusion image should integrate the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image with the metabolic activity data from the PET image. The fusion should maintain the grayscale clarity of the MRI, highlighting the brain's intricate structures, while overlaying the vibrant colors from the PET scan to indicate areas of high and low metabolic activity. This composite image would provide a clear, detailed view of both the physical and functional aspects of the brain, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

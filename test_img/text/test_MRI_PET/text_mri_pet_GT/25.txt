The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the color-coded metabolic activity from the PET image. This composite would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve the clarity of brain structures, while selectively applying the vibrant reds, yellows, and blues of the PET to highlight areas of high to low metabolic activity. The result should provide a clear, integrated visual representation that combines anatomical detail with functional information, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

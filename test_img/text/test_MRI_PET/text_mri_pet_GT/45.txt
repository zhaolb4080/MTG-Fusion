The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image with the metabolic or functional data from the PET image. The MRI provides high-resolution details of the brain tissues, which should form the grayscale background, showing structures like the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and sulci clearly. Overlaid on this, the PET image should contribute vibrant color mapping that highlights areas of metabolic activity or abnormalities, such as regions of high glucose uptake or areas of reduced activity, without obscuring the underlying anatomical details.

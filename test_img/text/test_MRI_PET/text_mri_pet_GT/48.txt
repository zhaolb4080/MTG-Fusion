The ideal fusion image should maintain the detailed anatomical structure visible in the MRI image, with the grayscale brain tissues clearly delineated. It should overlay the metabolic activity data from the PET image, using its color scale ranging from blue (low activity) to red (high activity), to highlight areas of different metabolic rates directly on the anatomical structures. This fusion should result in an image where the precise brain anatomy is visible beneath a semi-transparent, color-coded map of metabolic activity, allowing for easy correlation between structure and function.

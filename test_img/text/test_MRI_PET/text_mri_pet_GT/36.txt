The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues, with the metabolic activity highlighted by the PET image, where areas of high activity are shown in red and yellow. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve tissue detail while incorporating color-coded activity data from the PET scan, ensuring that areas of interest such as regions with high metabolic rates are easily identifiable without obscuring underlying anatomical details. The result should be a coherent image that allows for simultaneous visualization of both structural and functional information, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

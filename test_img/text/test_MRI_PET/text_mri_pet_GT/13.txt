The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the metabolic activity highlighted by the PET image. The grayscale MRI provides clear outlines of brain tissues, which should serve as the base, while the bright colors from the PET (ranging from blue to red indicating varying levels of activity) should be superimposed accurately onto the corresponding anatomical regions. This composite image would allow for precise localization of metabolic activity within the detailed structural context of the MRI, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues, with the metabolic activity highlighted by the PET image, where areas of high activity are shown in red and yellow. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve tissue detail while integrating the colored hotspots from the PET to indicate areas of metabolic significance, ensuring that the color does not obscure the underlying anatomical details. This composite image would provide a comprehensive view that combines anatomical structure with functional information, useful for precise diagnostic and therapeutic planning.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the color-coded metabolic activity from the PET image. This composite would maintain the high-resolution grayscale background of the MRI, where the brain's intricate details like the ventricles and cortical folds are clearly visible. Superimposed on this, the vibrant colors from the PET scan—ranging from blue (low activity) to red (high activity)—would highlight areas of metabolic function or dysfunction, providing a comprehensive view of both structure and function in a single image.

The ideal fusion image should integrate the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the metabolic or functional data from the PET image. The fusion should maintain the grayscale clarity of the MRI, highlighting the brain's intricate structures, while overlaying the PET's color-coded metabolic activity, particularly emphasizing areas of high activity in red and yellow. This composite image would allow for precise localization of functional abnormalities within the detailed anatomical context, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

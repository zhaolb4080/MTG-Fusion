The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image with the metabolic activity data from the PET image. The grayscale MRI provides clear delineation of brain tissues, which should serve as the base, while the vibrant colors from the PET image (ranging from blue to red indicating varying levels of activity) should be superimposed to highlight areas of metabolic function or dysfunction. This composite image would allow for precise localization of functional abnormalities within the detailed anatomical context provided by the MRI.

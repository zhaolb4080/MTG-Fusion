The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues, with the metabolic activity highlighted by the PET image, where areas of high activity are shown in red and yellow. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve tissue detail while integrating the colored hotspots from the PET to indicate areas of metabolic significance. The result should provide a clear, single image that aids in identifying regions where anatomical and functional data coincide, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

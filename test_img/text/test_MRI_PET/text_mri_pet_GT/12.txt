The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues, with the metabolic activity depicted in the PET image, where areas of high activity are highlighted in bright yellow and orange. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve tissue details while integrating the colored hotspots from the PET to indicate areas of metabolic significance. This combination would provide a comprehensive view that highlights both structural and functional information, aiding in accurate diagnosis and assessment.

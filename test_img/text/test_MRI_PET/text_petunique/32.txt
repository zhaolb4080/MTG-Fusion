The PET image displays varying intensities of colors, primarily in shades of yellow, orange, and blue, which represent different levels of metabolic activity within the brain. The brighter areas, particularly in yellow and orange, indicate regions of higher metabolic activity, which could be associated with active brain functions or abnormalities. The image background is predominantly dark, enhancing the contrast and focus on the metabolic activity shown.

The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors ranging from red to blue, indicating different levels of metabolic activity within the brain. The red and yellow areas suggest higher activity, while the blue and green areas indicate lower activity. This color mapping provides a functional view of brain metabolism, which is not visible in structural imaging.

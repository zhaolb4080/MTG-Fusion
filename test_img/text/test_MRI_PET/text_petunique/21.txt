The PET image distinctly displays varying intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow in various regions of the brain. This color variation helps in identifying functional abnormalities such as areas of high or low activity which could be indicative of disease states. The image provides a functional view of the brain, focusing on biochemical processes, unlike structural imaging.

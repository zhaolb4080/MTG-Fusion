The PET image displays various colors representing different levels of brain activity, with areas of high activity shown in yellow and red, and areas of lower activity in blue and green. This color mapping highlights metabolic processes, such as glucose consumption, providing insights into the functional state of brain tissues. The image's resolution and contrast are focused more on depicting physiological and biochemical changes rather than detailed anatomical structures.

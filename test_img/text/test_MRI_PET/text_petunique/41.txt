The PET image uniquely displays various colors representing different levels of metabolic activity within the brain, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue showing lower activity. This color mapping provides a functional view of brain metabolism, highlighting areas of biochemical changes. The image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but focuses on the physiological aspects of brain function.

The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity or functional information within the brain. The colors in the PET image highlight areas of high and low activity, providing insights into brain function that are not visible through structural imaging alone. This functional imaging technique is particularly useful for observing metabolic processes and can be critical in diagnosing and monitoring neurological diseases.

The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity or functional processes within the brain. The colors in the PET image highlight areas of high (red and yellow) and low (blue) activity, providing insights into brain function rather than structural details. This functional mapping is crucial for identifying metabolic states and assessing neurological conditions.

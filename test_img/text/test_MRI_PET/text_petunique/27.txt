The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow in various regions of the brain. This color variation helps in assessing functional aspects of the brain, such as glucose consumption and oxygen usage. The image provides a visual representation of brain function, which is crucial for identifying areas affected by conditions like tumors, epilepsy, or Alzheimer's disease.

The PET image displays various colors representing different levels of metabolic activity within the brain, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue showing lower activity. This color mapping provides a functional view of brain metabolism, highlighting areas of intense and minimal activity. The image's resolution and contrast are focused on capturing biochemical changes rather than detailed anatomical structures.

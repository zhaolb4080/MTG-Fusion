The PET image displays various intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity within the brain. The brighter colors, particularly yellow and red, highlight areas of higher metabolic activity, which can be useful for assessing brain function and identifying abnormalities. The overall image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structure but provides critical functional information about the brain's metabolic processes.

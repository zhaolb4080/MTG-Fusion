The PET image displays various colors representing different levels of metabolic activity within the brain, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue representing lower activity. This color mapping highlights functional aspects of the brain, such as glucose consumption or blood flow, which are critical for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders. The image provides a visual representation of brain function rather than structural details.

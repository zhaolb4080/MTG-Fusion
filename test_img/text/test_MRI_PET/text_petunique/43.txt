The PET image displays various colors representing different levels of brain activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue showing lower activity. This color mapping provides a functional view of metabolic processes, such as glucose uptake, in different regions of the brain. The image is useful for assessing brain function and detecting abnormalities related to metabolic changes.

The PET image uniquely displays varying levels of metabolic activity within the brain, indicated by a color scale ranging from blue (low activity) to red (high activity). This color mapping highlights functional aspects of the brain, such as glucose consumption, which is critical for identifying metabolic states and abnormalities. The image provides a visual representation of brain function rather than structural details, emphasizing areas of potential concern in neurological health.

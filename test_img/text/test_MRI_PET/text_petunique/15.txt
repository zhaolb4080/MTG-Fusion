The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity within the brain. The colors highlight functional aspects, such as glucose consumption, which can be critical for identifying areas of increased or decreased activity associated with various brain functions or pathologies. This functional mapping is distinct from structural imaging, providing insights into physiological processes.

The PET image displays varying intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity within the brain. The colors highlight functional aspects, such as glucose metabolism or blood flow, which can be critical for diagnosing and monitoring neurological diseases. The image provides a visual representation of functional data, which is essential for understanding brain activity patterns.

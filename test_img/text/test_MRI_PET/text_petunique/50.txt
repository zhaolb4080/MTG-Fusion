The PET image uniquely displays varying levels of metabolic activity within the brain, indicated by a color scale ranging from blue (lower activity) to red (higher activity). This color mapping highlights functional aspects of the brain, such as areas of high glucose consumption. The image provides a visual representation of brain function, rather than just structure, which can be crucial for diagnosing and monitoring various neurological conditions.

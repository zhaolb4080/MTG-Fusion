The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity or functional processes within the brain. The colors in the PET image provide a visual representation of brain function, highlighting areas of high and low activity. This functional imaging contrasts with structural imaging by focusing on metabolic changes rather than anatomical details.

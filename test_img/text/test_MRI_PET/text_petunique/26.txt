The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity or functional processes within the brain. The colors in the PET image highlight areas of high (red) and low (blue) activity, providing insights into brain function that are not visible through structural imaging alone. This functional visualization can be crucial for diagnosing and understanding neurological conditions, assessing brain function, and monitoring therapy efficacy.

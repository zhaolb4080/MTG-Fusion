The PET image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying colors indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow. Red and yellow areas signify higher activity, while blue and green indicate lower activity. This visualization helps in assessing functional aspects of the brain, such as glucose metabolism or oxygen usage.

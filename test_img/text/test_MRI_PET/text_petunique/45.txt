The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors representing different levels of metabolic activity within the brain, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue showing lower activity. This color mapping provides a visual representation of functional processes, such as glucose metabolism, which is critical for identifying areas of the brain that are more or less active under certain conditions. The image is particularly useful for assessing brain function and detecting abnormalities related to metabolic changes.

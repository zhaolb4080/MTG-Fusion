The PET image displays various colors representing different levels of metabolic activity within the brain, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue showing lower activity. This color mapping provides a functional view of brain metabolism, highlighting areas of increased or decreased activity that could be relevant for diagnosing and monitoring diseases. The image's resolution and contrast are focused on metabolic function rather than detailed anatomical structures.

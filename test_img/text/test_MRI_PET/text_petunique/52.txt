The PET image uniquely displays various intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity or functional information within the brain. The colors are distributed in a pattern that highlights specific areas, suggesting the regions of higher or lower activity. This color-coded functional mapping provides insights into the physiological processes of the brain.

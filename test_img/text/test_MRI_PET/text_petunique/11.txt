The PET image uniquely displays metabolic activity within the brain using color variations, where areas of higher activity are shown in warmer colors like yellow and red. This image provides a functional view of brain activity, highlighting regions of metabolic intensity that could be linked to different brain functions or pathologies. The dark background contrasts sharply with the brightly colored areas, emphasizing the regions of interest.

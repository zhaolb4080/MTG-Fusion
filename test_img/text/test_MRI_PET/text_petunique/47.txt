The PET image displays various colors representing different levels of brain activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue showing lower activity. This color mapping provides a visual representation of metabolic processes or blood flow in the brain. The image is useful for assessing functional abnormalities related to conditions such as tumors, epilepsy, or neurodegenerative diseases.

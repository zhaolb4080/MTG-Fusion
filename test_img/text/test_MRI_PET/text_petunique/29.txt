The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors, primarily blues, yellows, and reds, which represent different levels of metabolic activity within the brain. This color coding highlights areas of high and low activity, providing insights into functional aspects of the brain. The image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but focuses on biochemical processes.

The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity within the brain. The colors highlight functional aspects, such as glucose consumption or blood flow, in various regions of the brain. This visualization technique allows for the assessment of physiological and biochemical processes.

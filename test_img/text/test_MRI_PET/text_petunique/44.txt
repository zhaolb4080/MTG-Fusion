The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors representing different levels of metabolic activity within the brain, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue showing lower activity. This color mapping provides a visual representation of functional processes, such as glucose metabolism, which is critical for identifying areas of abnormal activity. The image is particularly useful for assessing brain function and detecting changes related to conditions such as tumors, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy.

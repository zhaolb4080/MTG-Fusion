The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity or functional processes within the brain. The red and yellow areas suggest regions of higher activity, while the blue and green areas indicate lower activity. This color mapping provides a visual representation of brain function, unlike structural imaging.

The PET image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying colors indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow. The brighter colors, such as red and yellow, typically signify higher activity, while cooler colors like blue indicate lower activity. This imaging technique is particularly useful for observing functional processes in the brain, such as glucose metabolism or oxygen usage.

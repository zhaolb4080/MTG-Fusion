The PET image displays varying intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity within the brain. The brightest areas, shown in red and yellow, highlight regions of highest activity, which are primarily located in the lower parts of the brain in this view. This color-coded functional visualization contrasts with structural imaging by emphasizing metabolic or biochemical function rather than anatomical details.

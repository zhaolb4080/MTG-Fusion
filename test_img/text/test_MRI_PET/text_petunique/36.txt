The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors representing different levels of metabolic activity within the brain, with areas of high activity shown in red and yellow, and lower activity in blue and black. This color mapping provides a functional view of brain activity, highlighting regions of metabolic interest that could be critical for diagnosis and treatment planning. The image's focus on metabolic function contrasts with structural imaging, offering insights into physiological processes.

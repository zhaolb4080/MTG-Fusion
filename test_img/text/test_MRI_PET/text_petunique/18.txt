The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity within the brain. The red and yellow areas signify higher activity, typically associated with regions of increased glucose uptake. This color-coded functional information contrasts with structural imaging, providing insights into brain function and metabolism.

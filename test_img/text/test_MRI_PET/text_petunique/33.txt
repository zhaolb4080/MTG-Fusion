The PET image displays various intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity within the brain. The brighter colors, such as yellow and red, highlight areas of higher metabolic activity, which can be useful in identifying functional abnormalities or assessing brain function. The overall image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structure but provides essential functional information about brain metabolism.

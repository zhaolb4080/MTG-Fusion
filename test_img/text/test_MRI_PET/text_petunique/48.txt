The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors ranging from blue to red, indicating different levels of metabolic activity or functional processes within the brain. The colors in the PET image provide a visual representation of biochemical changes, highlighting areas of high and low activity. This image is particularly useful for assessing brain function and detecting abnormalities related to metabolism.

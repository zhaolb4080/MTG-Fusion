The PET image distinctly displays varying intensities of colors representing different levels of metabolic activity within the brain, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue showing lower activity. This color mapping provides a functional view of brain metabolism, highlighting areas of neurobiological interest. The image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but focuses on biochemical processes.

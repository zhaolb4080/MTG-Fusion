The PET image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors representing different levels of metabolic activity within the brain, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue showing lower activity. This color mapping provides a functional view of brain metabolism, highlighting areas of activity that are crucial for diagnosing and monitoring various brain disorders. The image's resolution and contrast are tailored to emphasize metabolic function rather than anatomical structures.

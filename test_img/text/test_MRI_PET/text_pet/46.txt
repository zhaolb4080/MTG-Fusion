This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from a horizontal (axial) perspective. The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue indicating lower activity. The scan shows symmetrical activity in various brain regions, which is typical in a healthy brain, suggesting normal functioning and metabolism.

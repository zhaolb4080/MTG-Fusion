This brain PET (Positron Emission Tomography) image displays various levels of metabolic activity throughout different regions of the brain. Areas with high metabolic activity are shown in yellow and red, indicating higher glucose consumption, typically associated with active brain function. Conversely, the blue and black areas represent regions with lower activity, suggesting less metabolic demand or potentially underactive regions.

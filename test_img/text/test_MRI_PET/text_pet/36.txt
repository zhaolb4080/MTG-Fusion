This brain PET (Positron Emission Tomography) image displays various levels of metabolic activity in different regions of the brain. The areas highlighted in red and yellow indicate higher metabolic activity, which are typically associated with active brain functions such as processing and cognition. The cooler colors like blue and black represent regions of lower activity, which could be less active parts of the brain or areas with reduced function.

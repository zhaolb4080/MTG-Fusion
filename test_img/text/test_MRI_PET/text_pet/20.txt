This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from the top (axial view). The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue indicating lower activity. The distribution of activity can be used to assess brain function and to identify abnormalities related to various neurological conditions.

This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, showing various levels of metabolic activity. The areas highlighted in red and yellow indicate regions of higher metabolic activity, which could be associated with active brain functions such as thinking or processing information. Conversely, the blue and black areas represent regions of lower activity, which might be less engaged during the time of the scan.

This brain PET (Positron Emission Tomography) image displays various levels of metabolic activity in different regions of the brain. The areas highlighted in red and yellow indicate higher metabolic activity, which could be associated with regions of increased brain function or abnormal activity depending on the clinical context. The cooler colors like blue and black represent areas of lower metabolic activity.

This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transverse (horizontal) plane. The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue indicating lower activity. The distribution of activity suggests a focus on the frontal and temporal regions, which are often associated with functions such as reasoning, behavior, and memory.

This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transaxial perspective. The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue indicating lower activity. The scan shows significant activity in the frontal and temporal regions, which are areas typically associated with functions such as reasoning, behavior, memory, and speech.

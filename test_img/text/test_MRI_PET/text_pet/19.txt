This brain PET (Positron Emission Tomography) image displays various levels of metabolic activity in different regions of the brain, indicated by the color intensity. Areas with high metabolic activity are shown in yellow and red, suggesting higher glucose consumption, which is typical in regions actively engaged in tasks or in pathological conditions. Conversely, the blue and black areas indicate lower activity, which could be characteristic of less active or damaged brain tissue.

This brain PET (Positron Emission Tomography) image displays various levels of metabolic activity throughout different regions of the brain. Areas with high metabolic activity are shown in red and yellow, indicating higher glucose consumption, typically associated with active brain function. Conversely, the blue and black areas represent regions with lower activity, which could be due to a variety of factors including normal variation, decreased function, or pathological conditions.

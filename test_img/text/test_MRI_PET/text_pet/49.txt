This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from the top, showing various levels of metabolic activity. The colors range from blue and green, indicating lower activity, to yellow and red, indicating higher activity. The distribution of colors suggests areas of the brain that are more or less active, which can be useful for diagnosing and understanding neurological conditions.

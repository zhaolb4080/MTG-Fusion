This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transverse (horizontal) plane. The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue indicating lower activity. The distribution of activity shows higher metabolism in the periphery of the brain, particularly in the frontal and occipital regions, while the central areas, likely the ventricles, show minimal activity.

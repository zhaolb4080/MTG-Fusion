This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from above (axial view). The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue indicating lower activity. The scan shows symmetrical activity in various brain regions, suggesting normal brain function without obvious signs of abnormalities such as tumors or areas of decreased activity that might suggest neurological disorders.

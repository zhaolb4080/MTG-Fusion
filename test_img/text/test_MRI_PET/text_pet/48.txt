This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from above, showing various levels of metabolic activity. Areas with high metabolic activity are highlighted in red and yellow, indicating higher glucose consumption, typically associated with active brain regions. Conversely, the blue and green areas represent regions with lower activity, suggesting less metabolic demand.

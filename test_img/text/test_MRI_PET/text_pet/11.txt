This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from below. The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with warmer colors like yellow and red indicating higher activity and cooler colors like blue indicating lower activity. The symmetrical distribution of colors suggests a normal pattern of brain metabolism.

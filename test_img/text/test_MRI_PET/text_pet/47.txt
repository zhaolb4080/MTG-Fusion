This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transverse (horizontal) plane. The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue and green showing lower activity. The scan is symmetrical, suggesting a normal distribution of brain activity without visible signs of abnormalities such as tumors or lesions.

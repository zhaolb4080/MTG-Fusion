This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transverse (horizontal) plane. The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue and green indicating lower activity. The scan shows significant activity in the lower regions of the brain, which could be related to basic neurological processes or specific brain functions being assessed during the scan.

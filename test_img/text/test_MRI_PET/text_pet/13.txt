This brain PET (Positron Emission Tomography) image displays various levels of metabolic activity in different regions of the brain. The areas highlighted in red and yellow indicate higher metabolic activity, which could be associated with regions of higher neuronal activity at the time of the scan. The darker blue and black areas show lower metabolic activity, indicating less active regions during the scan.

This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from a horizontal perspective. The scan shows varying levels of metabolic activity, indicated by different colors: areas with high activity are shown in red and yellow, while areas with lower activity appear in blue and black. The distribution of activity suggests a focus on the frontal and temporal regions, which are typically associated with functions such as reasoning, behavior, and memory.

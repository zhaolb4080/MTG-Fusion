This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from the top. The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue indicating lower activity. The scan shows significant activity in the frontal and parietal regions, which are areas typically involved in cognitive functions and sensory processing.

This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from above, showing various levels of metabolic activity. Areas with high metabolic activity are displayed in red and yellow, indicating higher glucose consumption, typically associated with active brain regions. Conversely, areas in blue and green show lower activity, which could be less active brain tissue or regions of pathological concern depending on the clinical context.

This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from the top (axial view). The varying colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue indicating lower activity. Such scans are typically used to study brain function, detect abnormalities, and diagnose conditions.

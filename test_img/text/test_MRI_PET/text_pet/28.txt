This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from the top. The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue and green showing lower activity. The distribution of activity suggests a focus on the frontal and parietal regions, which are typically associated with functions such as decision-making, problem-solving, and sensory information processing.

This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transverse (horizontal) plane. The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue indicating lower activity. The symmetrical distribution of colors suggests a normal pattern of brain metabolism, with high activity in the cortex and lower activity in the central regions.

This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from above, showing various levels of metabolic activity. The areas in red and yellow represent higher metabolic activity, typically indicating regions of the brain that are more active, such as those involved in cognitive and sensory functions. Conversely, the blue and green areas indicate lower metabolic activity, which could be less active regions or potentially areas of concern depending on the clinical context.

This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from a horizontal (axial) perspective. The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with warmer colors like yellow and red indicating higher activity and cooler colors like blue indicating lower activity. The scan shows significant activity in the cerebral cortex, particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes.

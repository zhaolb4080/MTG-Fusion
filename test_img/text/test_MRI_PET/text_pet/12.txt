This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from a horizontal (axial) perspective. The scan shows varying intensities of colors, where areas of red and yellow indicate higher metabolic activity, typically associated with active brain regions, while blue and black areas indicate lower activity. This type of imaging is commonly used to study brain function, detect abnormalities, and diagnose conditions.

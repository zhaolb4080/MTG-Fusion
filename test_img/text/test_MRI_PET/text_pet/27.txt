This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from above, showing various levels of metabolic activity. The areas highlighted in red and yellow indicate regions of higher metabolic activity, which typically correspond to areas of higher brain function or activity at the time of the scan. Conversely, the areas in blue and green represent regions of lower metabolic activity.

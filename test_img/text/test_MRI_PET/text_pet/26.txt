This image is a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transverse (horizontal) plane. The colors in the image represent different levels of metabolic activity, with red and yellow indicating higher activity and blue indicating lower activity. The scan shows symmetrical high activity in the frontal and occipital regions, which could be indicative of normal brain function or specific neurological conditions depending on clinical context.

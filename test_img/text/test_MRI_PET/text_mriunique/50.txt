The MRI image displays high-resolution anatomical details, showcasing the intricate structures of the brain such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and sulci in a grayscale format. The contrast within the image highlights different tissue types, allowing for clear differentiation between white and gray matter. This type of imaging is particularly useful for examining the physical structure and integrity of brain tissues.

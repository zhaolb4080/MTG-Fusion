This MRI image displays a transverse section of the human brain at the level of the midbrain. The image shows clear differentiation between the gray matter and white matter, with the gray matter appearing darker and the white matter lighter. Notable structures visible include the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and ventricles, all of which are normal in appearance without visible abnormalities.

This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing detailed structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and basal ganglia. The scan provides a clear view of the brain's symmetrical hemispheres, indicating no immediate signs of asymmetry or abnormal masses. The image is likely taken at the level of the basal ganglia, showing the internal capsule and the surrounding gray and white matter clearly.

This MRI image shows a transverse (axial) section of the human head at the level of the cerebellum and brainstem. The image clearly delineates the cerebellum, characterized by its finely foliated structure, and the brainstem centrally located just above it. Surrounding these structures are the cerebrospinal fluid spaces of the subarachnoid space, which appear dark, contrasting with the lighter shades of the brain tissues.

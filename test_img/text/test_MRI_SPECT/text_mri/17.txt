This MRI image shows a transverse (axial) slice of a human brain at the level of the midbrain. The image displays various brain structures with good contrast, including the cerebellum at the bottom, the symmetric cerebral hemispheres with identifiable white and gray matter, and the brainstem centrally located. The ventricles and surrounding cerebrospinal fluid spaces appear as darker areas, providing contrast against the brighter tissue of the brain.

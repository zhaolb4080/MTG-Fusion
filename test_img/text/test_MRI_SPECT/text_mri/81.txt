This is an axial view MRI of the brain, showing normal anatomical structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and subcortical regions. The image does not display any obvious signs of abnormalities such as tumors, lesions, or significant asymmetry. The scan provides a detailed view of the brain's gray and white matter, useful for medical diagnosis and assessment.

This MRI image displays a transverse section of the human brain at the level of the midbrain. The image shows clear differentiation between the various brain structures, including the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and cerebellum. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres and the absence of abnormal masses or lesions suggest a normal brain anatomy in this section.

This MRI image shows an axial view of the human brain, providing detailed visualization of brain structures. The image displays symmetry in the cerebral hemispheres, with clear delineation of the cortical gyri and sulci. Darker areas likely represent fluid-filled spaces such as ventricles, and the overall brain tissue appears intact without visible signs of lesions or abnormalities.

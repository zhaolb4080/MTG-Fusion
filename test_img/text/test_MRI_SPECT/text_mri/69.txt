This MRI image displays an axial view of the human brain, showing the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and sulci. The image is characterized by high contrast between the gray matter of the cortex and the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid spaces. No obvious abnormalities such as tumors or lesions are visible in this section of the brain.

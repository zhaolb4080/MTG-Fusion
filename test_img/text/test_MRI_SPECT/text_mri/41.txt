This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing a detailed view of the cerebral cortex. The bright areas represent regions of higher fluid content, such as cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles and sulci. The darker areas indicate brain tissue, including the gyri and deeper structures of the brain.

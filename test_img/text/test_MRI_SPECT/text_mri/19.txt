This is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing detailed structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and cerebellum. The image provides high contrast between the different types of soft tissues, making it useful for identifying abnormalities or diseases. The scan appears to be normal without any obvious signs of lesions or abnormalities.

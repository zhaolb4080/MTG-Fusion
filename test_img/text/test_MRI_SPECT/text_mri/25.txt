This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing detailed structures of the cerebrum. The scan clearly depicts the gray matter of the cerebral cortex and the underlying white matter, as well as the basal ganglia, which are visible as brighter areas near the center. The ventricles, which contain cerebrospinal fluid, are also visible and appear as dark spaces in the middle of the brain.

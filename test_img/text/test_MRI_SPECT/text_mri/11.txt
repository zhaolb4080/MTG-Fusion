This MRI image shows an axial (horizontal) slice through the head at the level of the cerebellum and brainstem. The cerebellum appears prominently in the lower central part of the image, with its characteristic lobulated structure. Surrounding brain structures, including parts of the temporal lobes and possibly the occipital lobes, are visible around the cerebellum, with the darker areas representing cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles and subarachnoid space.

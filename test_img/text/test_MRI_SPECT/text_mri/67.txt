This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing a detailed view of the cerebral cortex and underlying structures. The scan provides high contrast between the gray matter of the cortex and the white matter beneath, allowing for clear visualization of the brain's anatomy. There are no obvious abnormalities or lesions visible in this section of the brain.

This MRI image displays an axial view of a human brain, showing detailed brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and sulci. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres appears normal, and there are no visible abnormalities or lesions. The image provides a clear view of the gray and white matter, which are essential for assessing brain health and function.

This MRI image shows an axial (horizontal) slice through the head at the level of the brainstem and cerebellum. The image displays the cerebellum prominently in the center with its characteristic lobular structure, surrounded by the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space that appears dark. The brainstem is visible just in front of the cerebellum, and the temporal lobes of the cerebral cortex are seen at the top sides of the image.

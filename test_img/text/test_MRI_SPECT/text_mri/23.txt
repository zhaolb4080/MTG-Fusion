This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing detailed structures of the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and subcortical regions. The scan provides a clear view of the gray and white matter differentiation, as well as the symmetry between the left and right hemispheres. The image is likely taken at the level of the basal ganglia, showing parts of the frontal lobes, temporal lobes, and the eyes in the orbital cavities.

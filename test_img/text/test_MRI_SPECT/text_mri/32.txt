This MRI image shows a transverse (axial) slice of the human brain at the level of the basal ganglia. The image displays good contrast between the white matter and the grey matter, with the cerebrospinal fluid appearing dark, highlighting the ventricular system in the center. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres of the brain appears normal, with no visible signs of lesions or abnormalities.

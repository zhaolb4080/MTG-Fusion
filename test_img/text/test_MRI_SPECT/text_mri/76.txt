This MRI image displays an axial view of the human brain, showing detailed brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and subcortical regions. The image appears to be a T1-weighted scan, as it provides high contrast between the gray matter and the white matter. There are no obvious abnormalities visible in this section of the brain, indicating a normal scan.

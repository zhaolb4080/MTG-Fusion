This MRI image displays an axial view of a human brain, showing detailed brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and subcortical regions. The image appears to be a T1-weighted scan, as it provides high contrast between the gray matter and the white matter. There are no obvious abnormalities visible, suggesting a normal brain anatomy in this slice.

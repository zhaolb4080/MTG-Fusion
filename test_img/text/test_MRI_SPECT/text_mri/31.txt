This MRI image displays an axial (horizontal) slice of the human brain, showing detailed brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and subcortical regions. The image appears to be a T2-weighted scan, as the cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles and surrounding the brain is bright, indicating high intensity on this sequence. The brain tissue is well-differentiated, with no immediately obvious signs of abnormalities such as tumors or lesions.

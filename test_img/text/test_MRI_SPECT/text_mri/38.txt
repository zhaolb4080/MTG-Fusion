This is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing detailed brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and sulci. The image provides a clear view of the symmetry between the left and right hemispheres, which is important for assessing normal brain function or pathology. The scan likely utilizes T2-weighted imaging, as it highlights fluid-filled areas like the ventricles and sulci in bright white, contrasting against the darker grey matter and black background.

This MRI image displays a transverse section of the human brain at the level of the cerebral hemispheres. The image shows clear differentiation between the gray matter of the cortex and the white matter of the inner brain, with the darker areas representing fluid-filled spaces such as ventricles. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres appears normal, with no visible signs of lesions or abnormalities.

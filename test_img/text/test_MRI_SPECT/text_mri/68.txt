This MRI image shows an axial (horizontal) slice of a human brain. The image clearly delineates the cerebral cortex, which appears as the outer layer with numerous folds and grooves, and the darker regions represent fluid-filled spaces or sulci. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres of the brain is evident, and there are no immediately obvious signs of abnormalities such as tumors or lesions.

This MRI image shows an axial (horizontal) slice of the human brain at the level of the cerebral hemispheres. The image displays symmetrical brain structures with clear differentiation between the gray matter (darker regions around the periphery) and white matter (lighter central areas). There are no obvious abnormalities such as lesions or asymmetries visible in this slice.

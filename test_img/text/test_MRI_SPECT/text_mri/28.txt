This MRI image shows an axial (horizontal) slice of the human brain. The image displays various brain structures with good contrast, including the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and subcortical regions. The symmetry between the left and right hemispheres appears normal, and there are no immediately obvious signs of abnormalities such as tumors or lesions.

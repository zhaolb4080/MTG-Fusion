This MRI image displays a transverse section of the human brain at the level of the midbrain. The image shows clear differentiation between the various brain structures, including the cerebral hemispheres, ventricles, and brainstem. The symmetry between the left and right sides of the brain appears normal, and there are no immediately obvious signs of abnormalities such as tumors or lesions.

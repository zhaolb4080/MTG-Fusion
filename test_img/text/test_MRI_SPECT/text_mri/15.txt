This MRI image displays an axial (horizontal) slice through the head at the level of the midbrain. The image shows the brain structures with high contrast, where darker areas typically represent fluid-filled spaces such as the ventricles, and lighter areas indicate brain tissue. Notable features include the symmetrical appearance of the cerebral hemispheres and the clear visibility of the cerebellum and brainstem at the base of the brain.

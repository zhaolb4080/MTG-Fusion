This MRI image shows a transverse (axial) slice of a human brain at the level of the midbrain and basal ganglia. The image displays symmetrical structures with clear differentiation between the gray matter and white matter, indicating healthy tissue contrast. Notable features include the bright signal of the cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles and surrounding the brain, as well as the dark appearance of the basal ganglia and thalamus.

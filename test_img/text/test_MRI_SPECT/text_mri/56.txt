This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing detailed brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and basal ganglia. The scan appears to be normal with no visible abnormalities in the brain tissue, ventricles, or other structures. The image provides a clear view of the symmetry and integrity of the brain, which is essential for diagnosing neurological conditions.

This MRI image displays an axial (horizontal) slice of the human brain at the level of the basal ganglia. The image shows clear differentiation between the gray matter and white matter, with the gray matter appearing darker and the white matter lighter. The ventricles, which are fluid-filled spaces within the brain, are also visible and symmetric, indicating no obvious signs of enlargement or displacement.

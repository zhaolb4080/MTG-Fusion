This MRI image displays an axial (horizontal) slice of the human brain, showing both cerebral hemispheres. The image highlights the contrast between the gray matter of the cerebral cortex and the white matter beneath, with the darker areas representing fluid-filled spaces such as ventricles. The symmetry and distinct separation of brain structures are clearly visible, indicating a focus on anatomical detail.

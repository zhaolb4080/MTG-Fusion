This MRI image shows an axial (horizontal) slice of the human brain, providing a detailed view of the cerebral cortex and underlying white matter. The image displays the symmetrical structure of the brain's hemispheres, separated by the midline fissure, with clear delineation of the sulci and gyri. The contrast and resolution of the image highlight the differences in tissue density, which is useful for identifying normal brain anatomy and potential pathological conditions.

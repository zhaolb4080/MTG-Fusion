This MRI image shows a transverse (axial) slice of a human brain at the level of the midbrain and temporal lobes. The image displays symmetrical structures with clear differentiation between the gray matter and white matter, indicating a normal scan without obvious abnormalities. The ventricles and sulci appear normal in size, suggesting no signs of hydrocephalus or significant atrophy.

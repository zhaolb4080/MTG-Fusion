This image is an axial MRI scan of the human brain, showing detailed brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, ventricles, and sulci. The scan provides a clear view of the gray and white matter, indicating normal contrasts typically used in medical imaging to assess brain anatomy and pathology. The symmetry between the two hemispheres suggests no immediate abnormalities, with clear delineation of the central sulcus and other landmarks.

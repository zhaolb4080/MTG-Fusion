The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional information from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI, providing detailed structural context, while the bright colors from the SPECT (blue, yellow, and red) would highlight areas of metabolic or functional activity, such as in the regions of the brain shown with high activity in the SPECT image. The fusion should ensure that the color highlights do not obscure the underlying MRI details but rather complement them, enhancing the visualization of both anatomical structure and functional data in a single image.

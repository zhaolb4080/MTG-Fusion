The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image. The grayscale MRI should serve as the base, providing clear outlines of brain structures, while the vibrant hues from the SPECT should highlight areas of metabolic activity or blood flow without obscuring the underlying anatomical details. The resulting image should offer a comprehensive view that combines structural integrity with functional insights, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and visualization.

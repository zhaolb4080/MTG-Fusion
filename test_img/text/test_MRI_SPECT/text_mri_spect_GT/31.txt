The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues and ventricles, with the color-coded functional information from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity using shades of orange and purple. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural detail, while selectively applying the color from the SPECT to areas corresponding to higher and lower activity levels, ensuring that the functional data enhances but does not obscure the anatomical detail. This would result in a composite image where anatomical landmarks are easily identifiable, enhanced by visually distinct functional data that indicates metabolic activity without overwhelming the structural view.

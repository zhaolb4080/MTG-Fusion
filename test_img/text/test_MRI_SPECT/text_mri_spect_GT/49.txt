The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image. The grayscale MRI provides a clear view of the brain's anatomy, including the ventricles and surrounding tissues, which should serve as a detailed backdrop. The vibrant colors from the SPECT image, indicating areas of activity, should be superimposed in a semi-transparent manner to allow for the visualization of both structural and functional information simultaneously.

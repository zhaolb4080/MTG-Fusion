The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the color-coded functional information from the SPECT image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background and sharp contours of the brain from the MRI, while selectively incorporating the vibrant orange and purple hues of the SPECT to highlight areas of metabolic activity or abnormalities. The result should provide a clear, integrated visualization where the precise anatomical details are enhanced by the functional insights, aiding in more accurate diagnosis and assessment.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues, with the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity in shades of orange and purple. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural detail while integrating the vibrant colors of the SPECT to indicate functional areas without obscuring underlying anatomical features. This would result in an image where the precise anatomical layout is visible, enhanced by color-coded regions that show metabolic variations, facilitating a comprehensive view of both structure and function in the brain.

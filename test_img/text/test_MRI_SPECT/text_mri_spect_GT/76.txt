The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the functional data from the SPECT image. The grayscale MRI image provides a clear outline of the brain's anatomy, which should serve as the base, while the color-coded regions from the SPECT image, indicating areas of activity, should be superimposed transparently to highlight functional areas without obscuring the underlying structures. The result should be a composite that maintains the sharpness of the MRI while incorporating the vibrant, color-coded functional information from the SPECT, allowing for precise localization of activity relative to anatomical landmarks.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear delineation of the brain's gyri and sulci in grayscale, with the functional data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity in varying shades of blue to red. The fusion should maintain the high-resolution detail of the MRI while incorporating the color-coded functional information from the SPECT, ensuring that the areas of highest activity (red and yellow regions) are accurately mapped onto the corresponding anatomical regions in the brain. This composite image would provide a comprehensive view that combines structural and functional insights, useful for precise diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

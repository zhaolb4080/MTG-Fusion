The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI, providing detailed structural context, while the vibrant hues from the SPECT (ranging from purple to orange) would highlight areas of metabolic activity or perfusion, clearly demarcating these regions within the anatomical framework. The fusion should ensure that the color mapping does not obscure the underlying MRI details but rather enhances the visualization of functional information in relation to the brain's anatomical structures.

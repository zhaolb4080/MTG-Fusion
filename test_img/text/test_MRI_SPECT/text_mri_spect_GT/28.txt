The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the color-coded functional information from the SPECT image. This composite should maintain the high-resolution grayscale background of the MRI to clearly depict the brain's anatomy, while selectively applying the vibrant color mapping of the SPECT to highlight areas of metabolic activity or perfusion. The fusion should ensure that the color does not obscure the underlying structural details, allowing for precise localization of functional data relative to anatomical landmarks.

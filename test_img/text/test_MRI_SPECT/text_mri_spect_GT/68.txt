The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional information from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural details, while the functional data from the SPECT would be superimposed in semi-transparent, vibrant colors to highlight areas of activity without obscuring underlying anatomical structures. The result should offer a clear, integrated view that facilitates the identification of both anatomical and functional abnormalities within the same spatial context.

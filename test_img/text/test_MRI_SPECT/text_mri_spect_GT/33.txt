The ideal fusion image should maintain the detailed anatomical structure visible in the MRI image, such as the clear delineation of the brain's ventricles and cortex, while integrating the functional color data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity in shades of orange and purple. The fusion should overlay the color data semi-transparently onto the grayscale MRI, ensuring that both structural and functional information are visible without one obscuring the other. This would result in an image where the precise anatomical details are enhanced by the functional insights, providing a comprehensive view that is beneficial for diagnostic purposes.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues and ventricles, with the functional data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity using color variations from blue to red. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural detail while integrating the color-coded functional areas from the SPECT, particularly emphasizing areas of high activity (red and yellow regions) without obscuring underlying anatomical details. The result should be a composite that allows for easy visualization of both anatomical structure and functional hotspots, enhancing diagnostic capabilities.

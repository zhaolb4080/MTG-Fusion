The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image. The grayscale MRI provides clear outlines of brain structures, which should serve as a detailed backdrop, while the vibrant oranges and purples of the SPECT image should highlight areas of metabolic activity or blood flow on top of this backdrop. This composite image would allow for precise localization of functional abnormalities within the anatomically accurate context of the MRI.

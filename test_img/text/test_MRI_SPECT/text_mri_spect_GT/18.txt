The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve the detailed view of the brain's structure, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT image would highlight areas of metabolic activity or blood flow. The result should be a clear, single image that allows for easy identification of both anatomical structures and functional information in their precise locations.

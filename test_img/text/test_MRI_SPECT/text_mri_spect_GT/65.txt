The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural details, while selectively applying the color gradients from the SPECT to highlight areas of metabolic or functional activity. The result should offer a clear, integrated view where the precise anatomical structures are easily correlated with functional hotspots, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and visual assessment.

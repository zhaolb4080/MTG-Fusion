The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural details, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT (purple, green, orange) should highlight areas of functional activity without obscuring underlying anatomical features. The resulting image would provide a comprehensive view that combines anatomical structures with functional insights, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and visualization.

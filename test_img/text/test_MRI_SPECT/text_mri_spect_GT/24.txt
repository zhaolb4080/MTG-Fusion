The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve the detailed view of brain structures, while the vibrant hues from the SPECT image would highlight areas of metabolic activity or blood flow. The resulting image should offer a clear, integrated visualization where the functional hotspots from the SPECT are accurately mapped onto the corresponding anatomical regions in the MRI, enhancing diagnostic interpretation.

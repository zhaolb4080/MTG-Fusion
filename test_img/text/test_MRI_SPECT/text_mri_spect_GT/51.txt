The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which is in grayscale, with the functional data from the SPECT image, which uses a color scale to indicate activity levels. The fusion should maintain the clarity and resolution of the MRI while incorporating the color-coded activity data from the SPECT, ensuring that the functional hotspots align accurately with the corresponding anatomical regions. This would result in a composite image where the precise brain structures are visible and enhanced by the functional color mapping, facilitating a comprehensive interpretation of both structure and function.

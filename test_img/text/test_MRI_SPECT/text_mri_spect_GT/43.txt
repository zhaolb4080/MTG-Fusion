The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the detailed anatomical structure provided by the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI, highlighting the brain's detailed anatomy, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT image would map onto corresponding regions to indicate varying levels of brain activity or function. The result would be a visually informative image that combines precise anatomical details with functional insights, enhancing the ability to diagnose and assess neurological conditions.

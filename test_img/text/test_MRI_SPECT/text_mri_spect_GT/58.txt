The ideal fusion image should maintain the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues, while integrating the functional color data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of brain activity in varying hues of orange and purple. The fusion should overlay the SPECT color data accurately onto the corresponding anatomical regions in the MRI, ensuring that the functional information aligns precisely with the structural outlines. The resulting image would provide a comprehensive view where the high-resolution grayscale anatomy is enhanced by the functional color mapping, facilitating better visualization of both structure and function in a single image.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the color-coded functional information from the SPECT image. This fusion should maintain the grayscale clarity of the MRI, highlighting the brain's structural details, while integrating the vibrant colors from the SPECT to indicate areas of activity or abnormality. The resulting image would provide a comprehensive view that combines anatomical precision with functional insights, where the colors should subtly blend over the corresponding anatomical regions without obscuring the underlying MRI details.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve the detailed view of brain structures, while the functional areas highlighted in orange and yellow from the SPECT would be superimposed to indicate areas of activity or abnormality. The fusion should ensure that the color mapping does not obscure the underlying MRI details but rather complements it, allowing for precise localization and assessment of both structure and function in a single view.

The ideal fusion image should maintain the detailed anatomical structure provided by the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues and ventricles. It should overlay the functional data from the SPECT image, where the color variations indicating different levels of activity or perfusion should be superimposed accurately onto the corresponding anatomical regions. The resulting image would use a semi-transparent color overlay, allowing for the visualization of both structural details and functional information in a single comprehensive view.

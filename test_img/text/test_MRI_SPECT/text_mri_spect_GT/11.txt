The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the functional color data from the SPECT image. The grayscale MRI provides a clear outline of the brain's anatomy, which should serve as a detailed backdrop, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT image should highlight areas of metabolic activity or blood flow without obscuring the underlying structures. The resulting image should offer a comprehensive view that combines anatomical detail with functional insights, using color transparency to ensure both layers are visible and informative.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI, providing detailed brain structures, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT (ranging from purple to orange) would highlight areas of metabolic activity or blood flow. The fusion should ensure that the color mapping does not obscure the underlying MRI details but rather complements them, allowing for precise localization of functional information within the anatomical context.

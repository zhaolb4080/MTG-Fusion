The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural details, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT should highlight areas of metabolic or functional activity without obscuring underlying anatomical landmarks. The fusion should be done in such a way that the colors are semi-transparent, allowing for both sets of information to be visible and easily interpreted.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues and fluid spaces, onto the color-coded functional data of the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity in shades of orange, purple, and yellow. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural detail while integrating the vibrant colors of the SPECT to denote varying levels of brain activity, ensuring that the colors do not obscure critical anatomical landmarks. The result should be a coherent image that allows for easy identification of both anatomical structures and functional information in a single view, enhancing diagnostic capabilities.

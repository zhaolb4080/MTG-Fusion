The ideal fusion image should maintain the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image, overlaying it with the color-coded functional information from the SPECT image. The grayscale background of the MRI should serve as the base, with the vibrant colors of the SPECT (ranging from purple to orange) highlighting areas of different activity levels, ensuring that these colors do not obscure the underlying structural details. This fusion should result in an image where the precise anatomical features are visible, complemented by a semi-transparent, color-coded map of functional data that enhances the visualization of physiological processes without overwhelming the structural view.

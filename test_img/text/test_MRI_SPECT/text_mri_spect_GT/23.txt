The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues, with the functional data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity in varying colors. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural detail, while incorporating the vibrant colors of the SPECT to indicate areas of high and low activity, ensuring that the colors do not obscure the underlying anatomical details. The result should be a coherent image that allows for easy identification of both structural and functional aspects in a single view, enhancing diagnostic capabilities.

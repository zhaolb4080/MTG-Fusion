The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear delineation of brain tissues and ventricles, with the functional data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity using color variations from blue to red. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural details, while integrating the color-coded functional areas from the SPECT, particularly emphasizing the red and yellow regions that indicate higher activity. This composite image would allow for precise localization of functional abnormalities within the accurate anatomical context provided by the MRI.

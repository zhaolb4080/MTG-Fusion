The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the functional color data from the SPECT image. The grayscale MRI provides a clear outline of the brain's anatomy, which should serve as the base, while the vibrant blues and reds of the SPECT image should highlight areas of metabolic activity or abnormalities, such as the bright spot seen in the SPECT. This composite image would allow for precise localization of functional changes within the accurately depicted anatomical framework of the MRI.

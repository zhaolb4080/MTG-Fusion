The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural details, while the bright colors from the SPECT (reds, yellows, and blues) should highlight areas of metabolic or functional significance, such as regions of high or low activity. The fusion should ensure that the color mapping does not obscure any underlying anatomical structures, allowing for precise localization of functional data relative to anatomical landmarks.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve the detailed view of brain structures, while selectively applying the color gradients from the SPECT image to indicate areas of metabolic activity or perfusion. The result should be a clear, integrated visualization where the precise anatomical structures are easily discernible beneath the functional hotspots shown in varying shades of orange and purple, enhancing the diagnostic utility of the image.

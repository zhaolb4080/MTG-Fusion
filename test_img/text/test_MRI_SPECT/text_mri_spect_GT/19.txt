The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues and ventricles, with the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity using shades of purple, orange, and yellow. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural details while integrating the vibrant colors of the SPECT to denote varying levels of activity, ensuring that the colors do not obscure critical anatomical landmarks. The resulting image should offer a comprehensive view that combines anatomical precision with functional insights, facilitating easier identification of areas of interest or concern by medical professionals.

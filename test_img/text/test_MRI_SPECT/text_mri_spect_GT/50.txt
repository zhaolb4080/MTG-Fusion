The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI, highlighting the brain's structures, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT (ranging from purple to orange) would indicate areas of different activity levels, superimposed accurately onto corresponding anatomical regions. The result would be a single image that provides a clear visual representation of both structural and functional information, facilitating easier interpretation and diagnosis.

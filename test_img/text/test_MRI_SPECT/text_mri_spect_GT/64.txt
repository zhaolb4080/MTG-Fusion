The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve the detailed view of brain structures, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT (ranging from purple to orange) should be semi-transparently mapped onto corresponding regions to highlight functional activity. The result should offer a clear, integrated visualization where anatomical and functional information are easily correlated, enhancing both the interpretability and diagnostic utility of the image.

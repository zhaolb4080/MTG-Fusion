The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues and ventricles, with the functional data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity in color. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural detail, while superimposing the colored hot spots from the SPECT where metabolic activity is highest, such as the bright yellow and red areas indicating higher intensity. This composite would allow for precise localization of functional activity within the anatomical context, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional information from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve the detailed view of brain structures, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT image (ranging from purple to orange) would highlight areas of metabolic activity or blood flow. The result would be a single image that provides a clear, detailed view of both the structural and functional aspects of the brain, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

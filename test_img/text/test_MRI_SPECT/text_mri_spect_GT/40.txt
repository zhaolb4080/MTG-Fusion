The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI, providing detailed brain structure, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT image would highlight areas of metabolic activity or blood flow. The result should offer a clear, integrated view that combines anatomical structures with functional insights, enhancing the ability to diagnose and assess neurological conditions effectively.

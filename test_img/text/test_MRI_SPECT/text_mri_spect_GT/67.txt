The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI, providing detailed brain structure, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT image would highlight areas of metabolic activity or blood flow. The result would be a single image that clearly delineates both structural and functional information, aiding in more accurate diagnosis and assessment.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues and ventricles, with the color-coded functional information from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity in varying shades of purple, orange, and yellow. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural detail, while the functional data from the SPECT should be semi-transparently mapped onto corresponding anatomical regions, allowing for an integrated view that emphasizes areas of high or low activity without obscuring underlying structures. This would result in a composite image where anatomical and functional insights are immediately apparent, facilitating more effective diagnosis and assessment.

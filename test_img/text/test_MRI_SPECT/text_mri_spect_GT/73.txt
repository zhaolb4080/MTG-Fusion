The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural details, while the bright colors from the SPECT (reds, yellows, and blues) should highlight areas of metabolic or functional activity without obscuring underlying anatomical structures. The result should be a composite that allows for easy visualization of both anatomical landmarks and functional data in a single image, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and interpretation.

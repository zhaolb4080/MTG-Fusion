The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues, with the functional data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity in varying colors. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural detail, while incorporating the color-coded metabolic information from the SPECT in a semi-transparent layer to allow both datasets to be visible and complementary. This would result in an image where anatomical landmarks are easily identifiable, enhanced by the functional insights provided by the color intensities indicating varying levels of brain activity.

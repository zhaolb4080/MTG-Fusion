The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the functional data from the SPECT image. The grayscale MRI should serve as the base, providing clear outlines and shapes of the brain's anatomy, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT (ranging from purple to orange) should overlay precisely on the corresponding anatomical regions to highlight areas of activity or concern. This fusion should maintain the integrity of the MRI's spatial resolution while effectively integrating the SPECT's color-coded functional information, ensuring that both structural and functional insights are visually accessible and interpretable.

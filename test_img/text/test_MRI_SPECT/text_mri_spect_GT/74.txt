The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural details, while the bright colors from the SPECT (ranging from blue to red indicating varying intensities) would highlight areas of metabolic or functional activity. The fusion should ensure that the color mapping does not obscure the underlying MRI details but rather complements them, allowing for precise localization of functional abnormalities within the anatomical context.

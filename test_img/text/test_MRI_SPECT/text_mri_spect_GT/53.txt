The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural details, while the vibrant hues from the SPECT (ranging from purple to yellow) would highlight areas of metabolic activity or blood flow. The fusion should ensure that the SPECT colors are semi-transparent to allow underlying MRI details to be visible, enhancing the ability to correlate physiological information with anatomical landmarks.

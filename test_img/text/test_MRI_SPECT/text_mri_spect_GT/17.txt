The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI, providing clear outlines and shapes of the brain's anatomy, while selectively incorporating the vibrant orange and purple hues of the SPECT to highlight areas of metabolic activity or perfusion. The result would be a visually informative image where the precise anatomical details are enhanced by the functional insights, allowing for easier identification and correlation of structural and functional abnormalities.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional information from the SPECT image onto the detailed anatomical structures visible in the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve the clarity of anatomical details, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT (ranging from purple to bright orange) would highlight areas of metabolic or functional activity. The fusion should ensure that the color mapping does not obscure the underlying MRI details but rather complements them, allowing for precise localization of functional data within the anatomical context.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI, providing detailed structural context, while the vibrant hues from the SPECT (purples, oranges) would highlight areas of metabolic or functional activity, clearly demarcated against the more subdued tones of the MRI. The fusion should ensure that the color mapping does not obscure the underlying MRI details but rather complements it, enhancing the visualization of both anatomical structures and functional information in a single view.

The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the functional data from the SPECT image. The grayscale MRI should serve as the base, providing clear outlines of the brain's anatomy, while the color-coded SPECT data should be superimposed to highlight areas of activity, using transparency to ensure that the underlying structural details remain visible. This fusion would allow for precise localization of functional abnormalities within the accurate spatial context of the brain's anatomy.

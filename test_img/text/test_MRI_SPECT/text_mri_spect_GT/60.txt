The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image. The grayscale background of the MRI would provide a clear outline and context of the brain structures, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT image would highlight areas of metabolic activity or perfusion, allowing for precise localization of functional information within the anatomical framework. The fusion should maintain the integrity of both images, ensuring that the functional data aligns accurately with the corresponding anatomical regions without obscuring critical details.

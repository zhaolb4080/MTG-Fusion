The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the functional data from the SPECT image. The grayscale MRI image provides clear outlines of the brain's anatomy, which should serve as the base, while the color-coded SPECT image, highlighting areas of activity, should be superimposed transparently to indicate functional regions such as metabolic hotspots. The resulting image would retain the anatomical detail in shades of gray, with areas of SPECT activity overlaid in semi-transparent, vibrant colors to allow for simultaneous visualization of structure and function.

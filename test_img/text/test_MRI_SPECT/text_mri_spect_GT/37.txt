The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which is in grayscale and shows clear delineation of brain tissues, with the functional data from the SPECT image, which uses color to indicate varying levels of activity within the brain. The fusion should maintain the high-resolution detail of the MRI while incorporating the color-coded functional information from the SPECT, ensuring that the colors do not obscure the underlying structural details. The resulting image should provide a comprehensive view that highlights areas of activity (from the SPECT) superimposed accurately onto the corresponding anatomical regions (from the MRI), facilitating easier interpretation of both structural and functional data in a single visualization.

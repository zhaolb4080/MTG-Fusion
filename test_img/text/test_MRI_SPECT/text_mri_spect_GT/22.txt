The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve the detailed view of brain structures, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT image would highlight areas of metabolic activity or blood flow. The resulting image should offer a clear, integrated visualization where the functional hotspots are accurately mapped onto the corresponding anatomical regions, enhancing diagnostic interpretation.

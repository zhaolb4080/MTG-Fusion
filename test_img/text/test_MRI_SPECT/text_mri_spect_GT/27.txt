The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite image would maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve the detailed view of brain structures, while the vibrant hues from the SPECT image would highlight areas of metabolic activity or blood flow. The result should be a clear, informative image where the functional data enhances the structural context without obscuring important anatomical landmarks.

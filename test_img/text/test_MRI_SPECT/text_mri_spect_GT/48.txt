The ideal fusion image should overlay the color-coded functional data from the SPECT image onto the high-resolution anatomical details of the MRI image. This composite should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve the detailed view of the brain structures, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT image should be semi-transparent to highlight areas of activity without obscuring the underlying anatomy. The result would be a single image that provides a clear, intuitive representation of both structural and functional information, facilitating easier interpretation and diagnosis.

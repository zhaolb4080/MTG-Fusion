The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the color-coded functional information from the SPECT image. The grayscale MRI provides clear delineation of brain tissues and ventricles, which should serve as a detailed backdrop. The vibrant colors from the SPECT, indicating different levels of brain activity or perfusion, should be superimposed accurately onto the corresponding anatomical regions in the MRI, enhancing the visualization of both structure and function in a single image.

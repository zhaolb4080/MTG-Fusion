The ideal fusion image should integrate the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the functional data from the SPECT image. The fusion should maintain the grayscale clarity of the MRI, highlighting the brain's intricate details, while overlaying the SPECT's color-coded metabolic activity in a semi-transparent manner to ensure both sets of information are visible and complementary. The resulting image would provide a comprehensive view where the high-resolution anatomical details are effectively enhanced by the functional hotspots indicated by the varying intensities of colors from the SPECT, aiding in precise diagnostics and treatment planning.

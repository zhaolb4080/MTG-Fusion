The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear delineation of brain tissues and ventricles, with the functional data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity in varying colors. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural details, while incorporating the color-coded functional areas from the SPECT image in a semi-transparent layer to allow for both sets of information to be visible and easily differentiated. This would result in an image where anatomical landmarks are easily identifiable, enhanced by color overlays that indicate functional activity without obscuring underlying structures.

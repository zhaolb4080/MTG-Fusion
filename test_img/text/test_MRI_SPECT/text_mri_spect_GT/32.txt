The ideal fusion image should maintain the detailed anatomical structure visible in the MRI image, such as the clear delineation of the cerebral cortex and ventricles. It should overlay the functional data from the SPECT image, which shows varying intensities of brain activity using a color scale from dark purple to bright yellow, onto the corresponding anatomical regions. The resulting image would use semi-transparent color overlays on the grayscale MRI, allowing for simultaneous visualization of both structural and functional information without obscuring critical anatomical details.

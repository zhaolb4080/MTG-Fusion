The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image with the functional data from the SPECT image. The MRI's grayscale clarity would provide a precise outline and internal details of the brain, while the SPECT's vibrant color palette would highlight areas of metabolic activity or perfusion within these structures. This composite image would enhance visualization of both structural and functional aspects, aiding in more accurate diagnosis and assessment.

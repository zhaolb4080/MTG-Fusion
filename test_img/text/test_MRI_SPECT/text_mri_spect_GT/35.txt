The ideal fusion image should maintain the detailed anatomical structure visible in the MRI image, such as the clear delineation of the brain's gyri and sulci, while integrating the functional color data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity in varying hues of purple, orange, and yellow. The fusion should ensure that the color data does not obscure the structural details but rather complements them, possibly by using transparency or color mapping techniques that allow both datasets to be visible and interpretable. The resulting image would ideally show a seamless overlay where the functional data enhances the anatomical context provided by the MRI, aiding in a more comprehensive understanding of both structure and function in the same visualization.

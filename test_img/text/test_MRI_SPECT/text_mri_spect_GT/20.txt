The ideal fusion image should maintain the detailed anatomical structure visible in the MRI image, such as the clear delineation of the brain's ventricles and surrounding tissues. It should overlay the color-coded functional information from the SPECT image, where areas of high activity are highlighted in warmer colors (reds and oranges), directly onto the corresponding anatomical regions in the MRI. This fusion should result in an image where the precise anatomical details are enhanced by the functional data, providing a comprehensive view that aids in accurate diagnosis and assessment.

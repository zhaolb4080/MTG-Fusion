The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear delineation of brain tissues and ventricles, with the functional data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity in varying shades of purple and orange. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural detail, while superimposing the colored SPECT data to indicate functional areas without obscuring underlying anatomical landmarks. The result should be a coherent image that allows for easy identification of both structural and functional aspects, enhancing diagnostic accuracy by correlating anatomical details with metabolic activity.

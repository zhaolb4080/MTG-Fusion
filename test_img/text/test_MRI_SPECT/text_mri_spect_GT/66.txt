The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structure from the MRI image with the color-coded functional information from the SPECT image. The grayscale background of the MRI should serve as the base, providing clear outlines and structures of the brain, while the vibrant colors from the SPECT image should highlight areas of activity or concern, such as regions of high or low perfusion, without obscuring the underlying anatomical details. The resulting image should offer a comprehensive view that combines anatomical precision with functional insights, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and visualization.

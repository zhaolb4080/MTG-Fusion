The ideal fusion image should overlay the detailed anatomical structures from the MRI image, which shows clear differentiation of brain tissues and ventricles, with the functional color data from the SPECT image, which highlights areas of metabolic activity in varying shades of purple and orange. The fusion should maintain the grayscale background of the MRI to preserve structural detail, while the color intensity from the SPECT should be adjusted to ensure it enhances but does not obscure the underlying anatomical details. This would result in an image where the precise anatomical layout is visible, complemented by color-coded functional information that indicates metabolic activity without overwhelming the structural view.

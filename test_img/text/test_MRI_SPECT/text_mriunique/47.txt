The MRI image displays high-resolution anatomical details, showcasing clear differentiation between various brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem. It is presented in grayscale, which emphasizes differences in tissue density and composition, allowing for detailed examination of the brain's physical structures. The image provides a cross-sectional view, which is crucial for assessing the integrity of both gray and white matter without the influence of functional activity.

The MRI image provides a detailed view of the brain's anatomical structure, showcasing clear differentiation between various types of tissues such as gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. The image is characterized by high spatial resolution, allowing for the visualization of fine details within the brain, including the ventricles and cortical gyri. The contrast in the MRI image is primarily based on the physical properties of the tissues, such as water content and density, which helps in identifying different brain structures and potential abnormalities.

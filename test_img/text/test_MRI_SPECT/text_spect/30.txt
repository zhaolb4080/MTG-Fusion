This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The varying colors from dark purple to bright orange represent different levels of brain activity or blood flow, with brighter areas indicating higher activity or flow. The symmetrical distribution of colors suggests a normal scan, but specific medical interpretation would require clinical context and expertise.

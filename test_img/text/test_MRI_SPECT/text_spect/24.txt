This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a human brain, viewed from the top looking down. The varying colors represent different levels of brain activity, with warmer colors like orange and yellow indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple showing lower activity. The scan is typically used for diagnosing and monitoring disorders affecting brain function, such as epilepsy, stroke, and dementia.

This image appears to be a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. The scan displays various intensities of colors, where the brighter areas, such as the orange and purple at the center, likely indicate higher levels of activity or blood flow. The surrounding darker areas suggest less activity or lower blood flow, typical in such imaging to highlight regions of interest, possibly indicating different physiological or pathological conditions.

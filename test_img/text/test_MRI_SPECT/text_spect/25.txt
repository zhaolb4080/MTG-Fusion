This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transverse (horizontal) plane. The colors in the image represent different levels of brain activity, with warmer colors like orange and yellow indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple showing lower activity. The scan is typically used for diagnosing and monitoring various neurological conditions by assessing blood flow and metabolic processes in the brain.

This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The areas highlighted in red and yellow indicate regions of higher metabolic activity or blood flow, which could be significant in diagnosing or evaluating neurological conditions. The surrounding areas in blue show less activity, which helps in contrasting and identifying the more active regions in the brain.

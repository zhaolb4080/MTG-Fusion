This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a brain, displayed in a transaxial view. The colors in the image represent different levels of brain activity, with warmer colors like orange and yellow indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple indicating lower activity. The scan shows a symmetrical distribution of activity, suggesting normal brain function in this particular slice.

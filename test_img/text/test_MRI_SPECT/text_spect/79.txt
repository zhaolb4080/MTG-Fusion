This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a brain, depicted in a top-down axial view. The image shows various intensities of blue and purple indicating different levels of brain activity or blood flow, with a prominent area of high activity shown in yellow and red at the bottom part of the brain. This pattern may suggest localized brain function or highlight a specific area of interest, possibly related to neurological conditions or brain metabolism.

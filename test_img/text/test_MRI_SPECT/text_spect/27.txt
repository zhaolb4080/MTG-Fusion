This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The varying colors from dark purple to bright orange represent different levels of activity or blood flow within the brain regions. The brighter areas typically indicate higher activity or perfusion, which can be analyzed to assess brain function or diagnose conditions.

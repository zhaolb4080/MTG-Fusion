This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. The image displays various intensities of colors, where brighter areas (yellow and red) indicate higher concentrations of the radioactive tracer, suggesting higher levels of activity or blood flow. The scan predominantly shows activity in the central region, possibly representing the brain or another organ, with distinct hot spots that could be indicative of specific functional areas or abnormalities.

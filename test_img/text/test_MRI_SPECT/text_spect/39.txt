This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The colors in the image represent different levels of activity or blood flow, with warmer colors like red and orange indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple indicating lower activity. The scan is typically used for diagnosing and monitoring various neurological conditions, assessing brain function, and evaluating abnormalities.

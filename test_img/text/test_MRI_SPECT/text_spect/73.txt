This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. The bright yellow and red areas indicate regions of higher radioactivity, suggesting higher levels of blood flow or metabolic activity. The scan likely represents a cross-section of the human brain, with the highlighted areas possibly indicating specific brain functions or abnormalities.

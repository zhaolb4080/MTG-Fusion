This image appears to be a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. The image displays two main areas of intense color: a smaller, purple area at the top and a larger, orange area at the bottom, suggesting regions of higher activity or blood flow. The surrounding areas are darker, indicating lower levels of activity or perfusion.

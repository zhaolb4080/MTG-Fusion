This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The varying colors from dark purple to bright orange represent different levels of brain activity or blood flow, with brighter colors typically indicating higher activity or perfusion. The symmetrical distribution of colors suggests a normal scan, but specific medical interpretation would require comparison to clinical findings and additional diagnostic information.

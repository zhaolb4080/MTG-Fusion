This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a brain, shown in a transverse section. The scan displays various intensities of blue and red colors, indicating different levels of brain activity or blood flow, with the brightest area (red and yellow) suggesting the highest concentration of the tracer, typically associated with higher metabolic activity or blood flow. The overall distribution and intensity of the colors can be used to assess brain function and diagnose conditions.

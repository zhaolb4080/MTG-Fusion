This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. It displays various intensities of orange and purple colors, indicating different levels of activity or blood flow in the brain. The brighter orange areas represent higher activity or perfusion, while the darker purple areas indicate lower activity, useful for diagnosing and monitoring various conditions.

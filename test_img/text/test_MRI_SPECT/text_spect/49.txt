This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The colors range from dark (indicating lower activity or density) to bright orange and yellow (indicating higher activity or density). The scan highlights areas of the brain that are metabolically active, which can be used for diagnosing and monitoring various neurological conditions.

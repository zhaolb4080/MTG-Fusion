This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which shows the distribution of metabolic activity in the brain. The colors range from dark (indicating lower activity) to bright orange and purple (indicating higher activity). The scan is likely a transverse (horizontal) section through the brain, showing symmetrical activity in various regions, which is typical for this type of medical imaging.

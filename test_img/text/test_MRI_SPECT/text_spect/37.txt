This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The varying colors from purple to orange represent different levels of activity or blood flow within the brain tissue. Areas with more intense colors, such as orange, indicate higher activity or perfusion, while darker areas indicate lower activity.

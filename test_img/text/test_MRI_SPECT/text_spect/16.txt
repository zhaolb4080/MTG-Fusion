This image appears to be a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. The image displays various intensities of colors, where the brighter orange and yellow areas indicate higher concentrations of the radioactive tracer, suggesting higher levels of activity or blood flow. The surrounding purple and dark areas indicate lower activity, typical of less perfused tissues.

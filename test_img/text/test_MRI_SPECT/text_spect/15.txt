This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. It displays various intensities of colors, where the brighter orange and yellow areas indicate higher concentrations of the radioactive tracer, suggesting higher levels of activity or blood flow. The image likely represents a cross-section of the human brain, with the distribution of colors providing information about brain function or the presence of abnormalities.

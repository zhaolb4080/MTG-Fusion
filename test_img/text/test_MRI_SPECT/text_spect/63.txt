This image appears to be a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a brain. The colors in the image represent different levels of activity or blood flow, with warmer colors like orange and red indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple indicating lower activity. The scan shows a symmetrical pattern, suggesting it is a view from above looking down at the cerebral hemispheres, with notable activity in the central and surrounding regions.

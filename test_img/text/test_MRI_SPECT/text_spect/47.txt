This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. It displays various intensities of orange and purple colors, indicating different levels of activity or function within the brain. The brighter orange areas suggest higher activity or perfusion, while darker purple areas indicate lower activity, useful for diagnosing and monitoring various neurological conditions.

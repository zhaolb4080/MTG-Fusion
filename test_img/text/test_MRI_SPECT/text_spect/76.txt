This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a brain. The majority of the brain appears in dark blue, indicating lower levels of activity or perfusion. A specific area in the lower right part of the brain is highlighted in red and yellow, suggesting a region of higher activity or blood flow, which could be significant in the context of neurological diagnostics or research.

This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The varying colors represent different levels of activity or blood flow, with warmer colors like orange and yellow indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple indicating lower activity. The scan is typically used for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders, assessing brain function, and evaluating brain abnormalities.

This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a human brain. The colors in the image represent different levels of activity or blood flow in various regions of the brain, with warmer colors like red and orange indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple indicating lower activity. The scan is typically used for diagnostic purposes, helping to identify abnormalities related to conditions such as epilepsy, stroke, tumors, and Alzheimer's disease.

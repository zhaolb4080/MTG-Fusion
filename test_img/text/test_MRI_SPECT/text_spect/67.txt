This image appears to be a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a brain. The colors in the image represent different levels of activity or blood flow in various parts of the brain, with warmer colors like orange and yellow indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple indicating lower activity. The overall symmetry and distribution of colors can provide insights into brain function and potential abnormalities.

This image appears to be a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. The image displays various intensities of colors, where areas of orange and purple likely indicate different levels of activity or blood flow within the organ or tissue being examined. The central dark area might represent a region with less activity or perfusion, surrounded by a more active peripheral region, suggesting this could be a cross-sectional view of a brain or another organ.

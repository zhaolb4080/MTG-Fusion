This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. It displays various intensities of blue and yellow, with the yellow areas indicating higher concentrations of the radioactive tracer, suggesting higher levels of activity or blood flow. The scan is likely focused on the brain, given the symmetrical, top-down view and the distinct areas of activity that could correspond to different brain regions.

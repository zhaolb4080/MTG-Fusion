This image appears to be a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. The image displays various intensities of colors, predominantly in shades of purple and orange, indicating different levels of activity or blood flow in the brain. The brighter orange areas suggest higher activity or perfusion, whereas the darker purple areas indicate lower activity.

This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. It predominantly features shades of purple and orange, indicating varying levels of activity or blood flow within the brain. The central part of the image shows a distinct pattern, possibly highlighting areas of higher or lower metabolic activity or perfusion.

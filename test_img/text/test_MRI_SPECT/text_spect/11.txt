This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. The scan displays various intensities of colors representing different levels of activity; the bright orange area indicates higher activity or uptake, commonly associated with higher metabolic activity or blood flow. The image likely represents a cross-section of the human brain, with the brighter areas possibly indicating regions of higher neuronal activity or abnormalities.

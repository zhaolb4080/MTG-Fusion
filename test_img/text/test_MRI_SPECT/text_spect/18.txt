This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The varying colors from purple to orange represent different levels of activity or blood flow within the brain regions. The brighter orange areas indicate higher activity or perfusion, commonly seen in regions such as the cerebellum and basal ganglia, while the darker areas show less activity.

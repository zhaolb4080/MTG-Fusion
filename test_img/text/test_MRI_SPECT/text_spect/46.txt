This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The colors in the image represent different levels of activity or blood flow, with warmer colors like orange and red indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple indicating lower activity. The scan is typically used for diagnostic purposes, helping to identify abnormalities related to blood flow and brain function.

This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transaxial perspective. The colors in the image represent different levels of brain activity, with warmer colors like orange and yellow indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple showing lower activity. The scan is typically used for medical diagnostics, including the assessment of brain function and blood flow.

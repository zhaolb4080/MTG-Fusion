This image is a Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transverse section. The colors in the image represent different levels of brain activity, with warmer colors like orange and yellow indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple and black indicating lower activity. The distribution of activity shows variations across different regions of the brain, which can be used to assess brain function and diagnose conditions.

This image appears to be a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. The image displays various intensities of colors, predominantly in shades of orange and purple, indicating different levels of activity or function within the organ or tissue being examined. The bright orange areas suggest regions of higher activity, possibly indicating higher blood flow or metabolic activity, while the purple and darker areas indicate lower activity.

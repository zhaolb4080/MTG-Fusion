This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The varying colors from purple to yellow represent different levels of brain activity or blood flow, with warmer colors typically indicating higher activity. The scan is used for medical diagnostics, particularly in identifying disorders related to blood flow and brain function.

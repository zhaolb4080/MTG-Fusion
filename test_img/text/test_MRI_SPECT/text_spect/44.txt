This image appears to be a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. The image displays various intensities of colors, where areas of purple and orange indicate different levels of activity or blood flow. The scan is likely of a human brain, with the brighter colors possibly indicating areas of higher metabolic activity or blood flow.

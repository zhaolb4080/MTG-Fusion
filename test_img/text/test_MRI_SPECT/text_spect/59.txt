This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a human brain, viewed from above. The colors in the image represent different levels of brain activity, with warmer colors like orange and yellow indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple showing lower activity. The symmetrical distribution of colors suggests a normal pattern of brain function or activity.

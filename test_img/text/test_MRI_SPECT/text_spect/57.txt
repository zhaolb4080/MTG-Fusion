This image is a Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scan, which shows the distribution of metabolic activity in the brain. The varying colors from dark blue to red indicate different levels of activity, with red representing higher activity and blue indicating lower activity. The image is likely a transverse (horizontal) section through the brain, showing symmetrical activity in various brain regions.

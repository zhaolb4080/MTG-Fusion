This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The varying colors from dark purple to bright orange indicate different levels of activity or blood flow in various regions of the brain. The brighter areas typically represent higher activity or perfusion, which can be analyzed for medical diagnosis or research purposes.

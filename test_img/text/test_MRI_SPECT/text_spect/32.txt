This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transverse plane. The scan shows various intensities of colors, where areas of orange and yellow indicate higher levels of brain activity or blood flow, while purple and dark areas represent lower activity. This type of imaging is used in medical diagnostics to evaluate brain function and to detect disorders such as strokes, tumors, or dementia.

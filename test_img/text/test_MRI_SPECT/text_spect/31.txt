This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transverse (horizontal) plane. The varying colors from dark purple to bright yellow represent different levels of brain activity, with brighter colors indicating higher activity. The scan is typically used for diagnosing and monitoring disorders by assessing blood flow and activity patterns within the brain.

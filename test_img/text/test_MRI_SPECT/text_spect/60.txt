This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a human brain, viewed from above. The colors in the image represent different levels of brain activity, with warmer colors like orange and red indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple indicating lower activity. The overall symmetry and distribution of colors suggest a focus on analyzing brain function, possibly to detect abnormalities or assess brain health.

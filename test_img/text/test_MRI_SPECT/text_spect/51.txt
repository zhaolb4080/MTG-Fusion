This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The varying colors from purple to yellow represent different levels of activity or blood flow within the brain, with warmer colors typically indicating higher activity. The scan is commonly used in medical settings to diagnose and monitor disorders such as dementia, epilepsy, and brain tumors.

This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. The image displays various intensities of colors, where areas of red and yellow indicate higher concentrations of the radioactive tracer, suggesting higher levels of activity or blood flow. The scan is likely focused on a specific organ or region within the body, possibly the brain, given the symmetrical and centralized distribution of the tracer.

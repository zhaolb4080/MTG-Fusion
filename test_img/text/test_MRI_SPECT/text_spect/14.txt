This image appears to be a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. The image displays various intensities of colors, where brighter colors like orange and yellow likely indicate higher levels of activity or blood flow, while darker colors such as purple and black indicate lower levels. The scan seems to focus on the brain, showing different functional areas with varying activity levels.

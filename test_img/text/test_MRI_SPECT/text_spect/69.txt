This image appears to be a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which is a type of nuclear imaging test that shows how blood flows to tissues and organs. It displays various intensities of orange and yellow colors at the center, suggesting areas of higher activity or blood flow, surrounded by a darker outline. The image is likely used for medical diagnostic purposes, possibly to evaluate brain function or to detect abnormalities.

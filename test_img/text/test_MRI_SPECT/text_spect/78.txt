This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, which shows the distribution of radioactive tracer uptake in the brain. The areas of blue indicate lower activity or uptake, while the bright yellow and red spot indicates a region of higher tracer accumulation, suggesting higher metabolic activity or blood flow in that specific area. This type of imaging is commonly used in medical diagnostics to observe blood flow and metabolic processes in tissues, particularly useful in detecting abnormalities such as tumors, infections, or brain disorders.

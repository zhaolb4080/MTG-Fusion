This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transaxial perspective. The colors in the image represent different levels of brain activity, with warmer colors like orange and yellow indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple and blue indicating lower activity. The scan shows significant activity in the central regions, possibly the basal ganglia, which are involved in motor control and various other neurological functions.

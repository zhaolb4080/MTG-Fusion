This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan showing a cross-sectional view of a human brain. The varying colors represent different levels of activity or blood flow within the brain, with warmer colors like orange and yellow indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple indicating lower activity. This type of imaging is commonly used in medical diagnostics to observe metabolic activity and to detect abnormalities such as tumors, infections, or brain function disorders.

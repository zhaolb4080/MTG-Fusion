This image is a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan of a human brain, viewed from a transverse (horizontal) plane. The colors in the image represent different levels of brain activity, with warmer colors like orange and yellow indicating higher activity and cooler colors like purple indicating lower activity. The scan shows symmetrical activity distribution in various brain regions, which is typical in a normal scan without focal abnormalities.

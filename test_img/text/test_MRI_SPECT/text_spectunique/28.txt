The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, using shades ranging from dark purple to bright yellow to indicate varying levels of function. This image primarily highlights metabolic processes or blood flow in the brain, rather than detailed anatomical structures. The use of color gradients in the SPECT image helps in assessing the functional status of different brain regions.

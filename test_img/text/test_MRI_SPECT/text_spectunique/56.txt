The SPECT image displays varying intensities of colors ranging from dark blue to bright orange, indicating different levels of activity or function within the brain. The image lacks the detailed anatomical structure seen in other imaging types, focusing instead on metabolic and functional aspects. The color gradients in the SPECT image are used to represent the distribution and density of specific radiotracers, reflecting physiological processes.

The SPECT image displays varying intensities of color, primarily blues with areas of yellow and red, indicating different levels of activity or function within the brain. The image is less detailed in terms of structural anatomy but highlights functional aspects such as blood flow or metabolic activity. The color gradation from blue to red suggests regions of lower to higher activity, respectively.

The SPECT image uniquely displays varying intensities of color, primarily in shades of orange and purple, which represent different levels of activity or function within the brain. This color mapping highlights areas of metabolic activity, providing a functional view of brain activity. The image lacks the detailed anatomical structure seen in other imaging types, focusing instead on physiological processes.

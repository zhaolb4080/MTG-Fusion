The SPECT image displays varying intensities of color, indicating different levels of activity or function within the brain, with red and yellow areas suggesting higher activity. This image provides a functional view, focusing on metabolic processes or blood flow. The resolution appears lower compared to structural imaging, emphasizing functional rather than anatomical details.

The SPECT image displays various intensities of color, primarily blues and yellows, which represent different levels of activity or function within the brain. This color mapping highlights specific areas of metabolic or blood flow activity, providing a functional perspective of brain activity. The image lacks the detailed anatomical structure seen in other imaging types, focusing instead on physiological processes.

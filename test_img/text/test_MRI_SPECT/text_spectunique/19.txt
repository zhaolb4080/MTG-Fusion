The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues indicating different levels of function or blood flow. The image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but highlights functional aspects such as metabolic activity. The use of vibrant colors ranging from purple to orange helps in visualizing and assessing regions of interest based on their activity levels.

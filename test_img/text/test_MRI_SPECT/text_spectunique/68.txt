The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation, highlighting areas of different activity levels within the brain, with warmer colors typically indicating higher activity. This imaging technique is particularly useful for visualizing functional processes such as blood flow or metabolic activity. The image appears less detailed in terms of structural anatomy compared to other imaging modalities, focusing instead on physiological changes.

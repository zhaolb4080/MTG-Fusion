The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying shades of orange, purple, and yellow indicating different levels of function or blood flow. This image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but provides functional information about the brain's metabolic processes. The color gradients are used to highlight areas of higher or lower activity, which can be crucial for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders.

The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, highlighting areas of metabolic function or blood flow with varying intensities of orange and purple hues. This imaging technique emphasizes functional aspects of the brain, providing a visual map of active regions during the time of scanning. The image lacks the detailed anatomical structure seen in other imaging types, focusing instead on physiological processes.

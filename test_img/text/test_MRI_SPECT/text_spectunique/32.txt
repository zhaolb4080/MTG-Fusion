The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues indicating different levels of function or blood flow. The image primarily uses shades of purple, orange, and yellow to differentiate areas of activity. This type of imaging is particularly useful for visualizing metabolic processes and can help in assessing functional abnormalities in the brain.

The SPECT image displays a range of colors from dark blue to bright orange, indicating varying levels of activity or function within the brain. The image is less detailed in terms of structural clarity but highlights functional aspects such as blood flow or metabolic activity. The overall appearance is blurry and less defined, focusing on physiological processes rather than anatomical structures.

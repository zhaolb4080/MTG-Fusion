The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, highlighting areas of high and low metabolic or blood flow activity with varying colors from blue to red. The image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but effectively visualizes functional processes. The bright red and yellow areas indicate regions of peak activity, contrasting sharply with the predominantly dark blue background representing lower activity levels.

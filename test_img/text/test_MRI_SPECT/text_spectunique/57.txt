The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues from dark blue to bright orange indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow. The image lacks the detailed anatomical structure seen in other imaging types, focusing instead on functional aspects of the brain. The bright orange areas suggest regions of higher activity or perfusion, which can be crucial for diagnosing and monitoring cerebral disorders.

The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues from purple to orange indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow. The image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but highlights functional aspects of the brain. The color gradients are instrumental in identifying areas of higher or lower activity, which can be crucial for diagnosing and monitoring various neurological conditions.

The SPECT image displays varying intensities of color, indicating different levels of activity or function within the brain, with areas of higher activity shown in yellow and red. This type of imaging is particularly useful for visualizing functional processes such as blood flow or metabolic activity. The image is less detailed in terms of structural anatomy compared to other imaging types, focusing more on physiological aspects.

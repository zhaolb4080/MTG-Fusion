The SPECT image displays various intensities of color, primarily in shades of orange, purple, and yellow, which represent different levels of activity or function within the brain. The colors are distributed in a pattern that highlights specific areas, suggesting the regions of higher or lower metabolic or blood flow activity. This functional mapping contrasts with structural imaging, providing insights into physiological processes.

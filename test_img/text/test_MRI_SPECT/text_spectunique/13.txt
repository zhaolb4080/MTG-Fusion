The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, highlighting areas of high and low metabolic or blood flow activity with different colors, such as purple and orange. This image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but provides functional information about the brain's active regions. The image's resolution appears lower compared to structural scans, focusing more on physiological processes.

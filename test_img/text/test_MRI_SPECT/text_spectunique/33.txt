The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues from purple to yellow indicating different levels of activity or function. This image provides a functional view of the brain, highlighting areas of metabolic activity and blood flow. The use of color gradients in the SPECT image helps in assessing physiological processes, which is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring certain neurological disorders.

The SPECT image displays varying intensities of color, highlighting areas of different activity levels within the brain, with a prominent red and yellow spot indicating a region of high activity. The overall image is less detailed in terms of structural anatomy compared to other imaging types, focusing instead on functional aspects such as blood flow or metabolic activity. The colors range from dark blue to red, providing a visual representation of the physiological processes occurring in different parts of the brain.

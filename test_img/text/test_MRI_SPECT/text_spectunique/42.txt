The SPECT image displays varying intensities of color, primarily in shades of orange and purple, which represent different levels of activity or function within the brain. The image is less detailed in terms of structural anatomy but highlights functional aspects such as blood flow or metabolic activity. The overall resolution and clarity are lower compared to structural imaging techniques, focusing instead on physiological processes.

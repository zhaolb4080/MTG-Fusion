The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow. The image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but highlights functional aspects such as areas of high or low activity. This functional mapping is crucial for identifying regions affected by conditions like epilepsy or dementia.

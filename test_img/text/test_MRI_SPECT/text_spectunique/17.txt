The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues from purple to orange indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow. The image lacks detailed anatomical structures but highlights functional aspects, such as areas of high or low activity. This functional mapping is crucial for assessing physiological processes and can aid in diagnosing and monitoring various neurological conditions.

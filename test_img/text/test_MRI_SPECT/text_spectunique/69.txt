The SPECT image displays varying intensities of colors, primarily in shades of orange and purple, which represent different levels of activity or function within the brain. The image is less detailed in terms of structural anatomy but highlights functional aspects such as blood flow or metabolic processes. The overall appearance is more abstract and less anatomically precise, focusing on physiological rather than anatomical information.

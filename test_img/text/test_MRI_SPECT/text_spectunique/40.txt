The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, highlighting areas of high and low metabolic or blood flow activity using varying hues from dark blue to bright yellow. This imaging technique provides functional information about the brain, indicating how different regions are working. The image is less detailed in terms of structural anatomy compared to other imaging modalities, focusing instead on physiological processes.

The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues indicating different levels of function or blood flow. The image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but highlights functional aspects such as metabolic activity. The use of vibrant colors in the SPECT image helps in distinguishing between areas of high and low activity, which is crucial for assessing physiological processes.

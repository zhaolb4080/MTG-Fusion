The SPECT image displays varying intensities of color, primarily in shades of blue, with specific areas highlighted in yellow and red, indicating regions of different activity or function within the brain. This color mapping is used to visually represent the distribution and density of certain radiotracers, reflecting metabolic or blood flow changes. The image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structure but provides functional information about the brain's active regions.

The SPECT image displays varying intensities of colors ranging from dark purple to bright orange, indicating different levels of activity or function within the brain. The image lacks the detailed anatomical structure seen in other imaging types, focusing instead on metabolic activity and blood flow. The brightest areas, particularly in orange, suggest regions of highest activity or perfusion at the time of scanning.

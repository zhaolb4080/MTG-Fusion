The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues from purple to yellow indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow. The image lacks the detailed anatomical structure seen in other imaging types, focusing instead on functional aspects. The bright areas suggest regions of higher activity or perfusion, which can be crucial for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders.

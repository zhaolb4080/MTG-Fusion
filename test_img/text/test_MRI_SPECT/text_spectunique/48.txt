The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues from purple to orange indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow in the brain regions. The image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but provides functional information about the brain's active areas. The use of vibrant colors in the SPECT image helps in visually distinguishing between regions of high and low activity, which is crucial for assessing functional abnormalities.

The SPECT image displays varying intensities of color, primarily in shades of purple, orange, and yellow, which represent different levels of activity or function within the brain. The image lacks the detailed anatomical structure visible in other imaging types, focusing instead on metabolic and functional information. The distribution of colors is not uniform, suggesting areas of higher and lower activity or perfusion within the brain tissue.

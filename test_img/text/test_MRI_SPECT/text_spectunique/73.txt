The SPECT image displays various intensities of color, indicating different levels of activity or function within the brain, with areas of high activity shown in yellow and red. This image provides a functional view, highlighting metabolic processes or blood flow. The resolution appears lower compared to structural imaging, emphasizing functional rather than anatomical details.

The SPECT image displays varying intensities of colors ranging from purple to orange, indicating different levels of activity or function within the brain. The colors in the SPECT image are used to represent metabolic or blood flow differences across the brain regions. This image type is particularly useful for visualizing functional information about brain activity, which can assist in diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders.

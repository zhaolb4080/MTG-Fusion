The SPECT image displays varying intensities of colors ranging from purple to orange, indicating different levels of activity or function within the brain. The image primarily highlights areas of high metabolic or blood flow activity, shown in bright orange, particularly concentrated in the lower central region. This color-coded functional view contrasts with structural imaging, providing insights into physiological processes.

The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues from purple to orange indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow. The image lacks the structural detail seen in anatomical scans but highlights functional aspects of the brain, such as areas of increased or decreased activity. This functional mapping is crucial for assessing physiological processes and can be used to detect abnormalities related to blood flow or metabolism.

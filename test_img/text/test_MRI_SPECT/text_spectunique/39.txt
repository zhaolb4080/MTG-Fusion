The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues indicating different levels of function or blood flow. The image is less detailed in terms of structural anatomy but provides functional information about the brain's active regions. The colors range from dark blue to bright orange, suggesting a gradient in activity levels across different areas of the brain.

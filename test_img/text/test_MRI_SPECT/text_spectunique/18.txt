The SPECT image uniquely displays varying intensities of color, representing different levels of activity or function within the brain tissue. The colors range from dark purple to bright orange, indicating areas of low to high tracer uptake respectively. This color variation helps in assessing the functional aspects of brain metabolism or blood flow.

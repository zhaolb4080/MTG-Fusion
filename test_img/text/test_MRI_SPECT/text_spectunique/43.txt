The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues indicating different levels of function or blood flow. The image lacks detailed anatomical structures but highlights functional aspects through its color gradients, from deep purple to bright yellow. This visualization technique is particularly useful for assessing areas of increased or decreased activity within the brain.

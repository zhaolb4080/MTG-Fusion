The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues indicating different levels of function or blood flow. The image primarily features shades of orange and purple, which visually differentiate areas of higher and lower activity. This type of imaging is particularly useful for observing metabolic processes and blood flow within the brain.

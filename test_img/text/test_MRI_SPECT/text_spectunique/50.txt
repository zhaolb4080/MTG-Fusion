The SPECT image uniquely displays varying intensities of colors, primarily in shades of purple, orange, and yellow, which represent different levels of activity or function within the brain. This color mapping highlights areas of metabolic or blood flow activity, providing a functional perspective of brain physiology. The image's resolution and detail focus more on depicting physiological processes rather than anatomical structures.

The SPECT image uniquely displays varying intensities of color, primarily in shades of orange and purple, which indicate different levels of activity or function within the brain. This color mapping highlights areas of metabolic or blood flow activity, providing a functional perspective of brain physiology. The image lacks the structural detail seen in other imaging types but excels in showing functional data which is crucial for assessing cerebral function and diagnosing conditions.

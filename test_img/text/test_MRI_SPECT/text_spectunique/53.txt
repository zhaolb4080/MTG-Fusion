The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues from purple to yellow indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow. This image provides a functional view of the brain, highlighting areas of higher and lower activity which can be crucial for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders. The use of color gradients in the SPECT image helps in visually distinguishing between regions of interest based on their functional attributes.

The SPECT image uniquely displays varying intensities of color to represent different levels of activity within the brain, with areas of higher activity shown in red and yellow. This color mapping provides a functional view of brain metabolism or blood flow, highlighting specific regions that are more active, potentially indicating areas of interest in neurological studies. The overall image is less detailed in terms of structure but focuses on physiological processes.

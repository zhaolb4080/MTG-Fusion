The SPECT image displays varying intensities of colors ranging from dark purple to bright yellow, indicating different levels of activity or function within the brain. This color variation helps in visualizing the functional aspects, such as blood flow or metabolic processes, of the brain regions. The image lacks the structural detail seen in anatomical scans but provides critical information on physiological changes.

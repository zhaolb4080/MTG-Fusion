The SPECT image displays varying intensities of color, predominantly in shades of blue, with specific areas highlighted in yellow and red, indicating regions of different activity or function within the brain. This color variation is used to represent the distribution and density of certain radiotracers, reflecting metabolic or blood flow differences across the brain tissues. The image is less detailed in terms of structural anatomy compared to other imaging types, focusing more on physiological processes.

The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues from purple to orange indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow. This image type is particularly useful for visualizing functional processes in the brain, such as areas of increased or decreased activity. The image lacks the structural detail seen in anatomical scans but provides essential insights into physiological and biochemical changes.

The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, highlighting areas of high and low metabolic or blood flow activity with varying hues from purple to yellow. This imaging technique provides a functional view of the brain, emphasizing regions of activity that could be critical for diagnosing and understanding neurological conditions. The image lacks the structural detail seen in anatomical scans but excels in showing physiological processes.

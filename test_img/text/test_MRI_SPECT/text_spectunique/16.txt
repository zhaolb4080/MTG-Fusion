The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation, highlighting areas of different activity levels within the brain, with warmer colors like orange indicating higher activity. This image type is particularly useful for visualizing functional information about brain metabolism or blood flow. The resolution appears lower compared to structural imaging, emphasizing functional rather than anatomical details.

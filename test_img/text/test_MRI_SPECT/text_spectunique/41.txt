The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation, indicating varying levels of activity or function within the brain, with warmer colors typically representing higher activity. This image is less detailed in terms of structural anatomy compared to other imaging types, focusing more on metabolic and functional aspects. The image appears blurry and has a lower resolution, which is characteristic of the SPECT imaging technique due to its focus on capturing dynamic processes.

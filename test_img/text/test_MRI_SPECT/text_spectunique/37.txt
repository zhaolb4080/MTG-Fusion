The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues indicating different levels of function or blood flow. The image is less detailed in terms of structural anatomy compared to other imaging types, focusing instead on metabolic and functional aspects. The colors range from dark purple to bright orange, suggesting areas of lower to higher activity respectively.

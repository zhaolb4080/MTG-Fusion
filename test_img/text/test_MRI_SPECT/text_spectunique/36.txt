The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, highlighting areas of high and low metabolic or blood flow activity with varying hues from purple to yellow. This image provides functional information about the brain, indicating regions of activity that could relate to different neurological conditions. The use of color gradients in the SPECT image helps in visually assessing the functional heterogeneity across different brain regions.

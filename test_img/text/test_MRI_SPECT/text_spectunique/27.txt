The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues from purple to yellow indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow in the brain regions. The image lacks detailed anatomical structures but highlights functional aspects, such as areas of high or low activity. This type of imaging is particularly useful for observing physiological processes and can be crucial in diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders.

The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues from purple to orange indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow. This image provides a functional view of the brain, highlighting areas of higher and lower activity which can be crucial for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders. The use of vibrant colors in the SPECT image helps in distinguishing between active and less active regions, which is not typically visible in standard grayscale imaging techniques.

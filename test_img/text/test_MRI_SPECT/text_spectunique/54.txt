The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues indicating different levels of function or blood flow. The image primarily uses shades of orange, yellow, and purple to differentiate areas of activity. This type of imaging is particularly useful for visualizing functional processes in the brain, such as metabolism or blood flow distribution.

The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, highlighting areas of high and low metabolic or blood flow activity with varying colors from deep purple to bright orange. This image provides functional information about the brain, indicating regions of activity that could relate to specific brain functions or abnormalities. The use of color gradients in the SPECT image helps in visually distinguishing between different levels of activity more distinctly than grayscale imaging.

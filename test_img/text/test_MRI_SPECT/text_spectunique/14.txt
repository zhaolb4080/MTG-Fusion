The SPECT image displays various colors representing different levels of activity or function within the brain, with areas of higher activity shown in warmer colors like orange and red. This image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but provides functional information about brain metabolism or blood flow. The overall resolution appears lower, and the image has a more blurred or smoothed appearance compared to high-resolution anatomical scans.

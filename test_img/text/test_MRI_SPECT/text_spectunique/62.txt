The SPECT image displays a range of colors from deep purple to bright orange, indicating varying levels of activity or function within the brain. The image is less detailed in terms of structural clarity but highlights functional aspects such as blood flow or metabolic processes. The overall appearance is more abstract and less anatomically precise, focusing on physiological rather than anatomical information.

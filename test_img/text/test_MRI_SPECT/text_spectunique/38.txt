The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues indicating different levels of function or blood flow. The image is less detailed in terms of structural anatomy but provides functional information about the brain's metabolic processes. The colors range from dark purple to bright yellow, suggesting areas of low to high activity respectively.

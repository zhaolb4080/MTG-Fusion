The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues indicating different levels of function or metabolic activity. The image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but highlights functional aspects such as blood flow or metabolic processes. The colors range from dark purple to bright orange, suggesting a gradient in the activity levels across different regions of the brain.

The SPECT image displays varying intensities of colors representing different levels of activity within the brain, with areas of high activity shown in red and yellow, and lower activity in blue. This color mapping provides a visual representation of functional information, indicating metabolic or blood flow variations across different brain regions. The image lacks the structural detail seen in anatomical scans but highlights functional aspects critical for assessing physiological processes.

The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, with varying hues from purple to orange indicating different levels of metabolic activity or blood flow. The image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but provides functional information about the brain's active regions. The colors in the SPECT image are used to visually differentiate areas of high and low activity, which is crucial for assessing physiological processes.

The SPECT image displays various intensities of color to represent different levels of activity within the brain, with brighter colors like yellow and red indicating higher activity areas. This imaging technique is particularly useful for visualizing functional information about brain metabolism or blood flow. The image is less detailed in terms of anatomical structures but provides critical insights into physiological processes.

The SPECT image displays a color-coded representation of brain activity, highlighting areas of high and low metabolic or blood flow activity with varying colors from deep purple to bright orange. This imaging technique is particularly useful for visualizing functional processes in the brain, such as areas of increased or decreased activity. The image lacks the detailed anatomical structure seen in other imaging types, focusing instead on physiological changes.

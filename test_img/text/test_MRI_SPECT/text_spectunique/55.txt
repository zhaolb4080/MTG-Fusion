The SPECT image displays varying intensities of colors ranging from dark blue to bright yellow, indicating different levels of activity or function within the brain. This color variation helps in assessing the functional aspects of brain regions, such as blood flow and metabolic activity. The image lacks the structural detail seen in anatomical scans but provides critical information on physiological processes.

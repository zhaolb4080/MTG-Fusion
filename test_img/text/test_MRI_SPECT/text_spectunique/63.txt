The SPECT image displays a range of colors from deep purple to bright orange, which represent different levels of activity or function within the brain. This color mapping highlights areas of high and low metabolic or blood flow activity, providing a functional view of brain physiology. The image is less detailed in terms of structural anatomy compared to other imaging types, focusing instead on the distribution of the radioactive tracer used during the scan.

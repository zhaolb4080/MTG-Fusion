In the visible light image, the scene includes distinct signage and branding, such as the illuminated "Caff√® Nero" sign on a building, which provides contextual information about the location. The colors and lighting variations, although captured at night, help in distinguishing different elements like the streetlights, vehicle headlights, and pedestrian crossings more clearly. The image also shows more detailed textures and contrasts in the urban environment, such as the road surface, building facades, and reflections on car surfaces.

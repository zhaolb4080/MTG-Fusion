In the visible light image, the house and surrounding environment are depicted with natural color tones, such as the dark roof and lighter walls, which reflect the actual colors visible to the human eye. The image captures finer details like the texture of the building materials and the foliage around the house. Additionally, shadows and lighting variations are more pronounced, providing a clearer sense of depth and dimension to the scene.

In the visible light image, the colors and textures of the house and surrounding vegetation are clearly distinguishable, providing a more detailed and realistic representation of the scene. The image shows distinct contrasts between the bright areas illuminated by sunlight and the shadows, enhancing depth perception. Additionally, the visible light image captures finer details such as window frames and roof textures, which are more defined compared to other imaging techniques.

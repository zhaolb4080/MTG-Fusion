The infrared image distinctly highlights the heat signatures of various objects, showing humans, vehicles, and other elements in bright white or light gray tones, indicating warmer temperatures. Cooler areas such as the sky and some parts of the buildings appear in darker shades, providing a clear contrast based on temperature differences. This thermal perspective is particularly useful for identifying living beings and running vehicles in low-light conditions.

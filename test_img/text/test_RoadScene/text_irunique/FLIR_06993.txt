The infrared image displays a high contrast between the building, sky, and vegetation, highlighting differences in heat emissions or reflectivity. The foliage appears very bright, possibly due to its higher infrared reflectivity compared to other elements in the scene. The overall scene has a surreal, negative-like appearance, emphasizing thermal variations rather than color and light as seen in typical photography.

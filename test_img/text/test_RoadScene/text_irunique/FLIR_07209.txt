The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing buildings and the tower with brighter tones, indicative of heat retention or emission. Vegetation appears in a darker tone, suggesting cooler temperatures compared to the built structures. The overall scene in the infrared image lacks the color information of the visible spectrum, focusing instead on temperature differences.

The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing trees and foliage as very bright due to their heat retention compared to the cooler, darker sky and road surfaces. This thermal contrast is not visible in typical light conditions. Additionally, the building in the background appears darker, suggesting it may not retain as much heat as the vegetation.

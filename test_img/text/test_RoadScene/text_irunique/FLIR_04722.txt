The infrared image distinctly highlights the thermal signatures of the vehicles, showing them as bright areas, which indicates they are warmer compared to their surroundings. The foliage and trees appear very light, almost white, suggesting they reflect infrared light differently than in visible light. The overall contrast and details in the infrared image are less defined, giving a ghostly and smooth appearance to the scene.

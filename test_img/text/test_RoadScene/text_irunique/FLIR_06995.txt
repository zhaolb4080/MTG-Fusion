The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing trees and the building facade in bright white, indicating they are emitting or reflecting more infrared radiation compared to the darker areas like the sky and road. The overall scene appears in a reversed or negative-like effect, with typical dark features appearing light and vice versa, emphasizing different material properties than visible in normal light. This imaging technique allows for the detection of features not easily seen in standard lighting conditions, such as subtle temperature differences and heat signatures.

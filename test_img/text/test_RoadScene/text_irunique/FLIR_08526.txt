The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which helps in identifying different objects based on their heat signatures. This imaging technique is effective in low-light conditions, as it does not rely on visible light to illuminate the scene. Additionally, the image provides a clear contrast between the warm engines of the cars and the cooler surroundings, such as the trees and buildings.

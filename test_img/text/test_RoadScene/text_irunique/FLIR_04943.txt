The infrared image uniquely highlights thermal signatures, where warmer areas such as the car's exhaust system appear brighter compared to cooler areas like the surrounding vegetation. The overall scene has a reversed or negative-like appearance, with typical dark features appearing light and vice versa. This type of imaging can reveal details not visible in standard lighting conditions, such as heat emissions from vehicles and other objects.

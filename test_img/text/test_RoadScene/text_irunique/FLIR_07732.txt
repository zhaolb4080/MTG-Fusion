The infrared image distinctly highlights the thermal signatures of objects, particularly the humans and vehicles, which appear brighter due to their heat emissions compared to the cooler surroundings. The sky and other less thermally active elements render darker, enhancing contrast with warm objects. This thermal perspective is particularly useful for visibility in low-light conditions, revealing details not apparent in normal lighting.

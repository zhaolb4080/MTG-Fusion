The infrared image uniquely highlights thermal variations, showing vehicles and trees with a bright, almost glowing appearance, which indicates different heat signatures compared to their surroundings. The road surface and sky appear uniformly dark, suggesting cooler temperatures relative to the brighter objects. This thermal perspective emphasizes different details that are not typically visible in standard light conditions, such as the heat emanating from the vehicles.

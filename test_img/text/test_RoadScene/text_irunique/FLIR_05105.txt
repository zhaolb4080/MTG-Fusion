The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing lighter areas where objects emit or reflect more infrared radiation, such as the road and some parts of the vehicles. The foliage appears darker, indicating less emission or reflection of infrared radiation compared to the surroundings. This image provides a unique perspective on heat distribution and material properties that are not visible in normal light conditions.

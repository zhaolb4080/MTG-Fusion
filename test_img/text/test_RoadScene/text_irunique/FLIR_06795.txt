The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which is particularly evident in the foliage and vehicles. The image lacks the color information typical of visible light photography, presenting a monochromatic palette that emphasizes temperature differences over color details. Additionally, the infrared image can provide clearer visibility in low-light conditions, as evidenced by the uniform illumination of the scene without reliance on visible light sources.

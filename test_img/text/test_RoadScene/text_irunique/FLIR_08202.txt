The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal signatures, where warmer objects such as the car's exhaust and the human figures appear brighter compared to the cooler surroundings like the road and trees. The foliage and trees, typically cooler, are rendered in darker shades, contrasting sharply with the warmer entities. This thermal differentiation aids in identifying living beings and mechanical operations in low visibility conditions.

The infrared image displays a uniform, monochromatic tone across the scene, highlighting temperature variations rather than color details. It effectively captures the thermal signatures of objects, making warmer areas appear brighter, such as the ground near the fence. This image type is particularly useful for visibility in low-light conditions, revealing details that are not perceptible in normal lighting.

The infrared image uniquely highlights thermal variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which is evident in the varying intensities seen in the vehicles and the environment. The foliage and trees appear very bright due to their thermal emission, contrasting sharply with the darker sky. Additionally, the image provides a clear view of the scene despite the absence of visible light, demonstrating the capability of infrared imaging to capture details in low-light conditions.

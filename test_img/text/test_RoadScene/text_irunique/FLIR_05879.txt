The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal signatures, making human figures and vehicles appear prominently brighter due to their heat emissions compared to the cooler surroundings. The buildings and the sky also exhibit varying degrees of thermal radiation, creating a gradient of brightness that helps in distinguishing different materials and surfaces based on their thermal properties. This thermal perspective is particularly useful for visibility in low-light conditions, where conventional lighting is minimal or absent.

The infrared image distinctly highlights the thermal signatures of the pedestrians and vehicles, making them appear brighter compared to the cooler surroundings like the trees and buildings. This thermal contrast emphasizes living beings and mechanical objects that emit heat, which are not as apparent in other types of imaging. Additionally, the overall scene in the infrared image appears in a monochrome palette, focusing on temperature differences rather than color details.

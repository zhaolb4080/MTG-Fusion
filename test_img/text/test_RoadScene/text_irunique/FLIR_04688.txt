The infrared image distinctly highlights the thermal signatures of the pedestrian and the dog, making them appear brighter against a relatively cooler background. The foliage and the sky, typically cooler, render a darker contrast compared to the warmer subjects. Streetlights and other inanimate objects do not show any significant thermal variation, maintaining a uniform appearance throughout the scene.

The infrared image displays a high contrast scene where the foliage of trees appears very bright, likely due to the infrared light reflecting off the leaves. The road and other surfaces appear darker, creating a stark contrast with the bright areas. This image provides a clear delineation of heat-emitting and non-heat-emitting surfaces, which is characteristic of infrared imaging.

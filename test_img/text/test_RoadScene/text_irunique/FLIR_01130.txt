The infrared image distinctly highlights temperature variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which is evident in the bright appearance of the vehicles and road surface. The foliage appears very light, almost white, indicating it reflects infrared light differently compared to other elements in the scene. This image also masks finer details like color variations and textures that are typically visible in standard light, focusing instead on thermal contrasts.

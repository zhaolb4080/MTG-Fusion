The infrared image displays a high contrast scene where the sky appears dark and the foliage on trees is very bright, almost white, indicating their heat retention or reflection characteristics. The road and vehicles have a uniform, ghostly appearance, lacking the color variation seen in typical visible light photography. This image highlights thermal properties rather than color, emphasizing temperature differences over visual hues.

The infrared image distinctly highlights temperature variations, showing warmer areas as lighter and cooler areas as darker, which is evident in the varying intensities seen in the trees, cars, and road. The image provides a clear view of the environment despite the absence of visible light, emphasizing thermal signatures such as those from street lamps and living beings. This type of imaging is particularly useful for night vision applications, as it can reveal details that are not visible in standard lighting conditions.

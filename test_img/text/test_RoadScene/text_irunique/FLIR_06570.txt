The infrared image uniquely highlights temperature differences, making the human figures and vehicles appear brighter due to their heat emissions against a darker, cooler background. The foliage and sky, typically cooler, render as darker areas, contrasting sharply with warmer objects. This thermal perspective emphasizes different details compared to typical visual cues, such as heat signatures from living beings and machines.

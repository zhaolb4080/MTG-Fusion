The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which helps in identifying living beings and warm objects more clearly. The foliage and trees appear very bright due to their heat retention, contrasting sharply with the cooler sky and road. The pedestrian on the street is also prominently visible against the darker background, emphasizing the heat emitted by humans.

The infrared image distinctly highlights the thermal signatures of the people and vehicles, showing them as brighter areas against a cooler background. This thermal contrast allows for clear differentiation between living beings and inanimate objects, even in low-light conditions. The overall scene appears more uniform in temperature, with less detail on surface textures compared to visible light imaging.

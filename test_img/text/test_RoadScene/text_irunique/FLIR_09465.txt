The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which helps in identifying living beings and warm objects even in low light conditions. The contrast between the warm figures of people and the cooler surroundings is pronounced, making human figures stand out against the background. Additionally, the foliage and sky appear uniformly dark, emphasizing the thermal footprint of objects rather than their visual appearance.

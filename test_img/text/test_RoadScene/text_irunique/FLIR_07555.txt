The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which helps in identifying living beings and objects based on their heat signatures. This imaging technique is particularly useful in low-light conditions as it does not rely on visible light. The contrast between the warm figures (likely humans) and the cooler background emphasizes the presence of heat-emitting entities in the scene.

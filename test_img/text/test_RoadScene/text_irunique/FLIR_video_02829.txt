The infrared image distinctly highlights temperature variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which helps in identifying living beings and warm objects even in low light conditions. The image lacks color information, presenting the scene in grayscale, which emphasizes thermal contrasts over color details. Additionally, the infrared image can penetrate through some types of fog and haze, potentially offering clearer views of distant objects under certain atmospheric conditions.

The infrared image distinctly highlights the thermal signatures of the pedestrians, making them appear brighter against the cooler background of the street and foliage. The foliage and trees, typically cooler than human bodies, appear darker, providing a stark contrast to the bright figures. Streetlights and other light sources emit a diffuse glow, enhancing visibility without the typical glare seen in visible light photography.

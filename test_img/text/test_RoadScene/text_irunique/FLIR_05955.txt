The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which helps in identifying different materials and objects based on their heat signatures. It also reveals details that are not visible in normal lighting conditions, such as the heat emanating from vehicles and buildings. Additionally, the image is less affected by lighting conditions, providing clear visibility regardless of the ambient light levels.

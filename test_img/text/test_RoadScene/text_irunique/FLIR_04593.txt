The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which helps in identifying different materials based on their heat signatures. The image lacks the color information that is typical in visible light photography, presenting a monochromatic view that emphasizes temperature differences rather than color or light intensity. This thermal perspective is particularly useful for detecting living beings and mechanical operations that emit heat, even in low visibility conditions such as night or fog.

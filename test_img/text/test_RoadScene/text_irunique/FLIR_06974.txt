The infrared image displays a high-contrast scene where vegetation appears very bright, almost white, indicating it reflects infrared light strongly. The architectural structures show varying degrees of brightness, suggesting different materials or temperatures. The overall scene has a surreal, negative-like appearance due to the inversion of typical light and dark areas seen in standard photography.

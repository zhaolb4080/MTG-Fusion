The infrared image displays a high-contrast scene where thermal variations are highlighted, showing cooler areas as darker and warmer areas as brighter. The texture of the road and other surfaces are more pronounced due to the thermal signatures. Additionally, the foliage on trees appears very bright, indicating they are reflecting infrared light differently compared to other elements in the scene.

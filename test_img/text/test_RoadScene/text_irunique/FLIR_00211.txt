The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal signatures, where warmer areas such as the car engines appear brighter compared to cooler areas like the sky and vegetation, which are darker. The overall contrast in the infrared image is more pronounced, emphasizing temperature differences rather than color or light as seen in typical photographs. Additionally, details such as license plates and vehicle design are less discernible due to the focus on heat emission rather than visual light reflection.

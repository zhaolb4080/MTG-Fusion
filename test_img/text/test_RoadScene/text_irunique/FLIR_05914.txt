The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which helps in identifying heat sources and temperature distribution. This imaging technique allows for visibility in low-light or dark conditions, revealing details that are not visible in normal lighting. Additionally, the infrared image can emphasize the presence of living beings through their heat signatures, making it useful for surveillance and security purposes.

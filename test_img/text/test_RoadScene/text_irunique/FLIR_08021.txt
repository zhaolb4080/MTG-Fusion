The infrared image distinctly highlights thermal variations, showing warmer areas as brighter and cooler areas as darker, which helps in identifying different materials and objects based on their heat signatures. This image type effectively captures details in low-light conditions, making it useful for night-time or obscured visibility scenarios. Additionally, the infrared image lacks the color information present in typical visible light images, focusing instead on intensity variations related to temperature.

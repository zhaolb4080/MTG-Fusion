The infrared image displays a high contrast scene where the heat signatures of various objects are distinctly visible, such as the warmer areas appearing brighter, which likely include vehicles and some parts of the road. The foliage, like palm trees, shows up in a lighter tone, suggesting cooler temperatures compared to the surroundings. This image provides a clear delineation of objects based on their thermal properties, which can be particularly useful in low visibility conditions.

The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed visual information from the visible light image, such as the clear color and texture of the car and the environment, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting the heat emissions from the car, the street, and the people. This fusion would enhance the visibility of warm objects, like the engine of the car and human figures, against the cooler background, providing a comprehensive view that emphasizes both physical details and thermal data. The resulting image would be beneficial for applications requiring enhanced situational awareness during low visibility conditions, such as nighttime or through smoke.

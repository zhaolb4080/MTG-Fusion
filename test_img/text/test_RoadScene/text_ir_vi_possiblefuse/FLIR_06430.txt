The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed environmental context provided by the visible light image with the thermal signatures from the infrared image. This fusion would highlight the warm figures of the person and the dog with enhanced thermal contrast, making them stand out against the detailed background of cars, street, and houses as seen in the visible light image. The overall scene would maintain the natural colors and lighting of the sunset from the visible light image, while integrating the distinct thermal outlines to emphasize living entities and other heat-emitting objects.

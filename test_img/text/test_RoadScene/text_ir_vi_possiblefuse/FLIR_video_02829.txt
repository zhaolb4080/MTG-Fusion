The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed context of the visible light image, such as the clear depiction of the street, traffic lights, and the bus, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting the warmth of the pedestrians and vehicles. This fusion would enhance the visibility of living beings and vehicles by overlaying their heat signatures onto the detailed scene, making them stand out against the cooler background of the street and foliage. The result should be a comprehensive image where both environmental details and thermal data are clearly visible, improving situational awareness especially in low-light conditions.

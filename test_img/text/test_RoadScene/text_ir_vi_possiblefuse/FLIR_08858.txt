The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the scene with the natural colors and details of the visible light image, such as the colors of the cars, sky, and vegetation. It should also integrate the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting the heat emissions from the vehicles and any warm objects or living beings, like the person next to the truck. This fusion would enhance details like the temperature variations, which are not visible in the standard light spectrum, while maintaining the context and clarity of the scene as seen in normal light.

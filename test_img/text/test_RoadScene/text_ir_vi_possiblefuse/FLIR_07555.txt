The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the scene by combining the detailed structural information from the visible light image, such as the building, bicycles, and palm tree, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, particularly highlighting the warm figures of the two people and the bicycle they are interacting with. This fusion would enhance the visibility of both the environment and the thermal details, making objects and people easily distinguishable. The background should maintain the night-time ambiance from the visible light image, while the thermal aspects should emphasize living entities and other heat-emitting objects, providing a comprehensive view of the scene.

An ideal fusion image combining these visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the scene with enhanced detail and contrast. The thermal signatures of the people and cars, which are prominent in the infrared image, should be superimposed on the visible light image to highlight temperature variations while maintaining the color and texture details of the environment, such as the buildings and street. This fusion would provide a comprehensive view that captures both the thermal activity and the visual context of the scene, making it easier to identify and analyze elements like human figures and vehicles at night.

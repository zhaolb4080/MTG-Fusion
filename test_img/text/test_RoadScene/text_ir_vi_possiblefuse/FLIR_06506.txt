The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed environmental context provided by the visible light image with the heat signatures from the infrared image. This fusion would highlight the warm figures of the people walking down the street, making them stand out against the cooler background of cars and vegetation. The overall scene would maintain the natural colors and lighting of the sunset from the visible light image, while integrating the thermal contrasts to enhance the visibility and distinction of living beings and objects based on their heat emissions.

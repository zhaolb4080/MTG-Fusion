The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the construction site and the road as seen in the visible light image, while incorporating the thermal signatures from the infrared image to highlight areas of heat, such as the warm exhaust of the vehicles and any warm machinery or human figures. This fusion would enhance details like the structure of the building and the road surface, maintaining the context and clarity of the daytime scene, but with added thermal data to indicate temperature variations. The person wearing a reflective vest, visible in the visible light image, should also be distinctly highlighted in the fusion image, showing both his visual and thermal presence effectively.

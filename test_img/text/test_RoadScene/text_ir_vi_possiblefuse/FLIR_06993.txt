The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the architectural details and ambient lighting from the visible light image, while integrating the thermal variations from the infrared image to highlight temperature differences in the scene. This fusion would enhance details such as the warmth of the building's windows and the cooler areas of the surrounding foliage and pavement, providing a comprehensive view that combines both aesthetic and functional data. The resulting image should maintain the night-time atmosphere while enhancing visibility and contrast to reveal more information about the environmental conditions.

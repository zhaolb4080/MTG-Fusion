The ideal fusion image of these visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the street scene at night, combining the detailed context of the visible light image (such as the cars parked along the street, the road surface, and the ambient lighting from street lamps) with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, particularly highlighting the warm figures of the people walking along the street. This fusion would enhance the visibility of both the environment and the human subjects, making the people stand out due to their heat signatures against the cooler background of the street and parked cars. The result should be a balanced image where both thermal and visible details are integrated to provide a comprehensive view that is useful for both navigation and surveillance purposes.

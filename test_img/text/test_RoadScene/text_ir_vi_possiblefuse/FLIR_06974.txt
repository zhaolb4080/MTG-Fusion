The ideal fusion image of the provided visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the architectural details and ambient lighting of the building as seen in the visible light image, while integrating the heat signatures from the infrared image to highlight warmer areas such as windows and possibly human figures. This fusion would enhance the contrast and details, making the building's structure more discernible at night while also indicating areas of thermal activity. The resulting image should balance the warm glow of the lights and the cooler areas of the vegetation and sky, maintaining a realistic yet informative representation of the scene.

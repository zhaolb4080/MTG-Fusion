The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the street scene with the detailed texture and color information from the visible light image, such as the vehicles, trees, and street details. It should also incorporate the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting the warm figures of the people walking on the sidewalk and standing near the crosswalk, which can enhance the visibility of living beings in low-light conditions. This fusion would provide a comprehensive view that combines both environmental context and the thermal presence of humans, useful for applications like surveillance and night-time navigation.

The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the scene with natural colors and lighting from the visible light image, while enhancing critical thermal details from the infrared image. For instance, the vehicles and the surrounding environment would maintain their realistic appearance from the visible light image, but areas of heat emission, such as the car engines or brakes, would be highlighted using thermal data, possibly with color mapping to indicate temperature variations. This fusion would provide a comprehensive view that combines both aesthetic and functional data, useful for applications like enhanced driving visibility or security monitoring.

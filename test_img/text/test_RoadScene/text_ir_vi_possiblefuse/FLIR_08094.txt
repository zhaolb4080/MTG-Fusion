The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed environmental context provided by the visible light image, such as the clear depiction of the street, parked cars, and trees, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, particularly highlighting the pedestrian's heat signature. This fusion would enhance the pedestrian's visibility against the cooler background, making the figure prominently stand out while maintaining the night-time street scene's ambient lighting and details. The result would be a balanced image where both thermal and visible features are integrated, improving overall scene interpretation, especially useful for applications like surveillance or navigation in low-light conditions.

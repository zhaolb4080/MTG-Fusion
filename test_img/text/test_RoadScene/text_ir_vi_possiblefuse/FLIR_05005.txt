The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the scene with the natural colors and details from the visible light image, such as the white car, the pedestrians, and the building in the background. It should also integrate the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting the heat emitted by the car and the pedestrians, which appear as bright areas in the infrared image. This fusion would enhance the visibility of warm objects, making it easier to identify and analyze human figures and other heat-emitting objects in various lighting conditions.

The ideal fusion image of these visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the street scene while highlighting thermal signatures. It would combine the detailed context of the street, cars, and trees from the visible light image with the highlighted figures of pedestrians and the warm engines of cars from the infrared image. This fusion would enhance the visibility of living beings and vehicles, making them stand out against the detailed background of the street and buildings, thus providing a comprehensive view that is useful for both navigation and surveillance purposes.

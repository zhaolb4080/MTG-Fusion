The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the street scene while enhancing critical details. It would combine the color and detail of the visible light image, such as the sunset sky and the natural colors of the cars and trees, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting warmer areas like car engines and possibly pedestrians. This fusion would result in an image where both environmental context and thermal details are visible, enhancing both navigation and surveillance capabilities.

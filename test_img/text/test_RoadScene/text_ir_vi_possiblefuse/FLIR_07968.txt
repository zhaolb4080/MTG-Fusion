The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the street scene at night, combining the detailed context of the visible light image with the thermal signatures from the infrared image. The cars parked along the street and the streetlights should maintain their visible light details, while the figures of the people walking, highlighted by their heat signatures in the infrared image, should be distinctly overlaid to enhance visibility and detail. This fusion would provide a comprehensive view that highlights both the environment and the thermal profiles of living beings, useful for enhanced nighttime visibility and surveillance.

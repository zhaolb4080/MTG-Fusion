The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the scene by combining the detailed environmental context from the visible light image, such as the sunset sky, street, and parked cars, with the enhanced visibility of people and objects from the infrared image. This fusion would highlight the warmth signatures of the bicyclist and skateboarder, making them stand out against the cooler background, while maintaining the rich color details of the sunset and surroundings. The result would be a balanced image where both thermal and visual elements are integrated to enhance overall visibility and detail, particularly useful in low-light conditions.

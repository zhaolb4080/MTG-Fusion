The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the street scene with enhanced details. It would combine the detailed texture and color information from the visible light image, such as the greenery, cars, and road, with the heat signatures from the infrared image, highlighting warmer areas like car engines and possibly human figures. This fusion would result in an image where both environmental details and thermal data are distinctly visible, enhancing both navigation and surveillance capabilities.

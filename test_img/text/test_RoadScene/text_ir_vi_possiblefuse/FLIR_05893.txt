The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the people and the car, combining the detailed outlines and colors visible in the visible light image with the heat signatures from the infrared image. This fusion would highlight the warm areas of the human figures and the car engine, while maintaining the ambient lighting and architectural details of the building and surroundings from the visible light image. The result should enhance visibility and detail, making both the thermal and visible features distinctly recognizable and informative.

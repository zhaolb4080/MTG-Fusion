The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the street scene with enhanced details. It would combine the vivid colors of the sunset and the sky from the visible light image with the detailed thermal signatures of the cars and the road from the infrared image. This fusion would result in an image where warm objects are highlighted for better visibility while maintaining the natural coloration of the environment, particularly enhancing the contrast and clarity of the parked cars and the street.

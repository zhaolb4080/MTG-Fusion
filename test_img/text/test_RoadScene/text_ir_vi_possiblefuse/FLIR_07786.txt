The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the street scene combining the detailed visual information from the visible light image, such as the colors and textures of the cars, road, and buildings, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, particularly highlighting the heat emitted by the person walking and any warm objects like running vehicles. This fused image would enhance the visibility of both warm and cool areas, making the person more distinguishable against the cooler background, while maintaining the ambient lighting and context provided by the visible light image. The overall result should offer a comprehensive view that leverages the strengths of both imaging modalities, providing a richer, more informative scene depiction.

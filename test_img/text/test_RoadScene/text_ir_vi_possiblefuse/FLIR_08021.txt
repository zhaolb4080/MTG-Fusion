The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the building and road as seen in the visible light image, maintaining the color details and ambient lighting. It should also integrate the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting warmer areas such as the vehicle and possibly human figures, enhancing visibility and contrast in these regions. This fusion would provide a comprehensive view that combines both the detailed scene context and the thermal anomalies or variations, useful for enhanced night-time visualization or surveillance purposes.

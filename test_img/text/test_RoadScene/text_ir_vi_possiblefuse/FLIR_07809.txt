The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the street scene while enhancing the visibility of the people and objects. It would combine the detailed context of the street, cars, and trees from the visible light image with the highlighted thermal signatures of the people from the infrared image, making the individuals stand out against the background. This fusion would ensure that both the environment and the thermal details of living beings are distinctly visible, providing a comprehensive view that is useful for both navigation and surveillance purposes.

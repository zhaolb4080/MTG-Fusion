The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the street scene while highlighting the thermal signatures of the people standing at the roadside. It would combine the detailed environmental context provided by the visible light image, such as the street, trees, and traffic lights, with the distinct heat signatures of the individuals from the infrared image. This fusion would enhance the visibility of the people against the nighttime background, making them stand out due to their heat emissions while maintaining the overall context of the urban setting.

The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed architectural features and ambient lighting from the visible light image with the heat signatures from the infrared image. This fusion would highlight the warm areas, such as lit windows and possibly warm vehicles, against the cooler background of the building and night sky. The resulting image would provide a comprehensive view that enhances visibility and detail while also indicating temperature variations, useful for both visual clarity and thermal analysis.

The visible light image distinctly captures the natural coloration of the environment, showing a sunset with hues of pink and orange in the sky, which adds a warm tone to the scene. It also clearly delineates the colors and models of the parked cars along the street, enhancing the details that contribute to the scene's realism. Additionally, the visible light image allows for the perception of depth and distance through the gradual fading of colors and light towards the horizon, which is not discernible in other types of imaging.

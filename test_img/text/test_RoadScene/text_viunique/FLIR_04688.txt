In the visible light image, colors are discernible, such as the green traffic light and the natural tones of the palm trees and sky, which provide a realistic representation of the scene. The image captures the subtle variations in lighting and shadows, particularly noticeable on the road and the figures crossing the street. Additionally, the details and textures of objects, like the pedestrian's clothing and the dog's fur, are more clearly defined compared to other imaging techniques.

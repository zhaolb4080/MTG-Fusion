In the visible light image, colors are distinguishable, such as the blue of the night sky and the various colors of the cars and buildings, providing a more detailed and realistic representation of the scene. The lighting sources, such as street lamps, cast visible shadows and illuminate specific areas, enhancing depth perception and spatial understanding. Additionally, the visible light image allows for the clear identification of textures and materials, like the asphalt of the parking lot and the siding on the buildings.

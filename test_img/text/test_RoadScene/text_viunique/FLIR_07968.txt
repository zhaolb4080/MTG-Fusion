In the visible light image, the colors of various objects such as cars, streetlights, and clothing are discernible, providing a more detailed and realistic representation of the scene. The lighting conditions, including the glow from street lamps and reflections on car surfaces, contribute to the depth and texture of the image. Additionally, the visible light image allows for the identification of specific features like the color of the vehicles and the ambient lighting, which helps in understanding the actual time of day or night.

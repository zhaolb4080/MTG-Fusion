The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed environmental context provided by the visible light image, such as the clear depiction of the street, cars, palm trees, and people, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting temperature variations. This fusion would enhance the visibility of warm objects, like the pedestrians and vehicles, making them stand out against the cooler background of the street and foliage. The result should be a single image where thermal data effectively overlays the visible scene, maintaining the scene's spatial and color details while emphasizing thermal differences critical for applications like surveillance or navigation.

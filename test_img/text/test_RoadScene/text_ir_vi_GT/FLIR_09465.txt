The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed environmental context provided by the visible light image, such as the clear depiction of the street, traffic lights, and bus, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting the warm figures of the people and vehicles. This fusion would enhance the visibility of both human figures and context, making the people stand out against the detailed background of the urban night scene. The resulting image would offer a comprehensive view where thermal highlights of living beings and vehicles are superimposed on a crisply defined urban landscape, enhancing both navigation and surveillance capabilities.

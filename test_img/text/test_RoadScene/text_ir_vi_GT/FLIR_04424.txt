The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the street scene while enhancing critical details. It would combine the natural color and detail of the buildings, cars, and palm trees from the visible light image with the highlighted thermal signatures of the vehicles and possibly pedestrians from the infrared image. This fusion would enhance contrast and detail, making it easier to discern features in various lighting conditions, particularly useful for identifying warmer objects like running vehicles and human figures in low visibility scenarios.

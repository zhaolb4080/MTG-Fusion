The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed structural information from the visible light image, such as the clear outlines of the houses, cars, and trees, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting areas of heat emission like car engines or any warm objects. This fusion would enhance the visibility of both warm objects and the environment, making it easier to identify and analyze the scene under various conditions. The result should maintain the natural color and detail of the visible light image while integrating the contrasting heat patterns from the infrared image to emphasize temperature differences within the scene.

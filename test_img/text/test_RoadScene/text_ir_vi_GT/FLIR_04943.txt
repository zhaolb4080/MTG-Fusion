An ideal fusion image combining the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the car with enhanced detail and contrast, highlighting the heat signatures from the vehicle and its surroundings while maintaining the natural colors and context of the visible light image. The background elements such as the trees, road, and buildings should be distinctly visible, with the thermal aspects emphasizing any heat variations, like the warmer areas of the car and the road. This fusion should result in an image where both thermal and visible details are balanced, providing a comprehensive view that is useful for both human observation and automated systems.

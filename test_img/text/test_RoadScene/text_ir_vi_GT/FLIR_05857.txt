The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the scene combining the detailed context of the visible light image with the thermal signatures from the infrared image. It would highlight the warm figures of the people standing in the parking lot, making them stand out against the cooler background of buildings and vehicles, while maintaining the color and texture details of the environment as seen in the visible light image. This fusion would enhance visibility and detail, making it easier to identify both the people and the context in which they are situated, such as the parked cars and the buildings around them.

The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the street scene, combining the detailed context of the visible light image, such as the cars, trees, and buildings, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image to highlight temperature variations. This fused image would enhance the visibility of warm objects, like running vehicles and possibly pedestrians, against the cooler background of the street and vegetation. The result should offer a comprehensive view that maintains the visual clarity of the daytime scene while emphasizing thermal contrasts critical for applications like surveillance or navigation.

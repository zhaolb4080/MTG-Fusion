The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the scene by combining the detailed thermal signatures from the infrared image with the visible light details from the second image. It should enhance the visibility of the people, vehicles, and structures, highlighting the warm areas (like the human figure and car engines) with the infrared data while maintaining the ambient lighting and color details of the street, buildings, and flag from the visible light image. This fusion would provide a comprehensive view that outlines both the thermal and visual aspects of the scene, making it easier to identify and interpret various elements at night.

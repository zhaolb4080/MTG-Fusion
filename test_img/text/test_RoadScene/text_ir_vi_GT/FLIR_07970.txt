The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed context of the visible light image, such as the clear depiction of cars, street, and houses, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, particularly highlighting the warm figures of the person walking on the street and any other heat-emitting objects. This fusion would enhance the visibility of both the environment and the thermal details, making the person more distinct against the cooler background of the street and parked cars. The overall image should maintain the night scene ambiance while emphasizing important thermal contrasts for better situational awareness.

The ideal fusion image of the provided visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the structure of the building, the tower, and the surrounding environment with the detailed texture and color information from the visible light image. It should also incorporate the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting areas of heat emission such as the windows and possibly the vehicles, which appear brighter in the infrared image. This fusion would enhance the visibility of important details in low-light conditions while also providing thermal context, making it easier to discern both structural and temperature-related features in the scene.

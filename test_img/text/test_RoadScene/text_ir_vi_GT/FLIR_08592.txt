The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the chain-link fence and the background landscape with the visible light's color details and clarity. It should also integrate the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting any warm objects or anomalies that are not visible in the regular light, such as the warm spots on the ground and possibly any animals or people that might be in the scene. This fusion would provide a comprehensive view that combines both the detailed visual appearance and the thermal characteristics, enhancing the visibility of details in low-light conditions while also detecting thermal anomalies.

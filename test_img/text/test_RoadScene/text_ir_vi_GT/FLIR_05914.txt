The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the building and the surrounding environment with the detailed texture and color information from the visible light image, while also highlighting the thermal signatures of the human figures and any other warm objects from the infrared image. This fusion would enhance the visibility of the people standing near the building, making them stand out due to their heat signatures against the cooler background. The overall scene would maintain the ambient lighting and color details of the night scene, ensuring a balanced representation of both thermal and visible spectrums.

The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the scene by combining the detailed context of the visible light image, such as the street signs, vehicles, and overall urban environment, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting warmer areas like car engines and street lights. This fusion would enhance the visibility of both warm objects and the ambient environment, making it easier to identify specific details like the condition of the cars and the layout of the street. The resulting image would offer a comprehensive view that includes both thermal and visible spectrum data, which could be particularly useful for applications like surveillance or navigation in low-visibility conditions.

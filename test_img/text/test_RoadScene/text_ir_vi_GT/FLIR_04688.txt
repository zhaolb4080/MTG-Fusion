The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the person and the dog with enhanced detail and contrast, combining the thermal signatures from the infrared image with the natural colors and textures from the visible light image. The background should maintain the clarity and context of the street scene, with the palm trees and traffic lights distinctly visible, ensuring a balanced exposure that highlights both the warmth of living beings and the ambient environment. This fusion would provide a comprehensive view that emphasizes important thermal details while retaining the visual appeal and informational content of the conventional photograph.

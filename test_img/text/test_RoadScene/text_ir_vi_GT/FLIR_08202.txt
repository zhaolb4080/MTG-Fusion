The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the scene by combining the detailed context of the visible light image with the thermal signatures from the infrared image. It should enhance the visibility of the car, the pedestrians, and the background environment by integrating the warm signatures of living beings and vehicles from the infrared with the natural lighting and color details of the visible light image. This fusion would result in an image where both the thermal anomalies and the visual details are balanced, making it easier to identify and analyze elements like the pedestrians crossing the street, the car's condition, and the surrounding infrastructure.

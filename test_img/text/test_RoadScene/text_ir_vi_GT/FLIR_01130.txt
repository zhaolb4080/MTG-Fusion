The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed environmental context provided by the visible light image with the thermal signatures from the infrared image. This fused image would clearly depict the road, trees, and cars with the natural colors and textures visible in the daylight image, while highlighting the heat signatures of the cars and the human figure, which are prominently visible in the infrared image. The result would be a comprehensive view that enhances situational awareness by showing both physical details and thermal data, which could be particularly useful for applications like enhanced vehicle navigation or security monitoring.

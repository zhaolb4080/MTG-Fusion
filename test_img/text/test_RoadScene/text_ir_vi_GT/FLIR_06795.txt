The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the street scene, combining the detailed context of the visible light image, such as the colors and textures of the cars, road, trees, and buildings, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting warmer areas like car engines and any pedestrians. This fused image would enhance the visibility of both non-living objects and living beings by integrating the color details with heat variations, making it easier to discern features in both day and night conditions. The result should maintain the spatial integrity of the scene, ensuring that all elements are aligned and accurately represented from both source images.

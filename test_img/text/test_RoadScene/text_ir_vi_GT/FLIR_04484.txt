The ideal fusion image should combine the detailed street and vehicle outlines from the infrared image with the natural colors and lighting of the visible light image. This fusion would highlight the thermal signatures of the cars and any pedestrians, which appear as brighter areas in the infrared image, while maintaining the realistic view of the street, buildings, and sky from the visible light image. The result should enhance visibility and detail, making it easier to identify objects and their thermal properties simultaneously.

The ideal fusion image of the visible light and infrared images should clearly depict the street scene while enhancing critical details. It would combine the detailed texture and color information from the visible light image, such as the cars, trees, and road, with the thermal signatures from the infrared image, highlighting warmer areas like car engines and possibly any pedestrians not visible in the visible light image. This fusion would result in an image where both environmental context and thermal anomalies are easily discernible, enhancing both navigation and surveillance capabilities.

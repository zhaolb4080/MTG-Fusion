The ideal fusion image should clearly depict the bus, cars, and the street environment from the visible light image, while integrating the thermal signatures of the people and vehicles from the infrared image to highlight their heat profiles. This fusion would enhance the visibility of the human figures, making them stand out due to their heat contrast against the cooler background, while maintaining the detailed context of the nighttime scene provided by the visible light image. The result should offer a comprehensive view where thermal and visible details are balanced, providing both environmental context and thermal data of the objects and people present.

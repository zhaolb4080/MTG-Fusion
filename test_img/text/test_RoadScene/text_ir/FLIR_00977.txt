The image depicts a residential street scene captured in infrared, resulting in a negative-like effect where darker areas in a normal photograph appear lighter and vice versa. Several cars are parked along the sides of the street, and lush, detailed trees line the road, their foliage rendered in intricate patterns due to the infrared imaging. The overall atmosphere is ghostly and surreal, emphasizing contrasts and textures not typically visible in standard photography.

This infrared image depicts a nighttime street scene featuring a bus, a car, and several pedestrians. The thermal signatures indicate varying degrees of heat emitted from the subjects, with the living entities (humans) appearing brighter due to their body heat. The background includes buildings and a palm tree, also captured in varying shades of gray, indicating lesser heat compared to the living subjects.

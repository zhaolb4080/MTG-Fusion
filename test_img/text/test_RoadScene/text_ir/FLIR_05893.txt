This infrared image captures a nighttime scene at a parking lot by a building, possibly near a pier or waterfront. Two figures, likely humans, are visible and appear bright due to their body heat contrasting with the cooler surroundings. The environment includes parked cars and street lamps, with the building featuring a sloped roof and what appears to be signage or a banner.

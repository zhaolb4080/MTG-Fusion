This infrared image depicts a street scene at night, featuring rows of parked cars on either side and a group of people walking down the center of the road. The trees lining the street and other details are rendered in a ghostly white due to the infrared imaging, which captures heat rather than light. The overall atmosphere is eerie and otherworldly, emphasizing the heat signatures of the people and vehicles compared to the cooler surroundings.
